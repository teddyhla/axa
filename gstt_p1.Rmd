# Anticoagulation in ECMO 

- Extra corporeal therapies - > anticoagulation. 
- GSTT - a large volume severe respiratory failure centre providing predominant VV-ECMO service. 
- Bleeding and thrombotic complications during ECMO are NOT uncommon. 
- __Multiple options__ : Activated Clotting Time (ACT), Activated Partial Thromboplastic time (aPTT),anti-factor Xa (Anti-Xa),prothrombin time and internationalised normal ratio (PT/INR)
--
<br>
<br>
<br>
- __apTT vs aXa__ ? 
- factor VIII, fibrinogen, lupus anticoagulant, acute phase reactants affect apTT
- Research challenging : due to low volume.
- small signal aXa may be a superior correlate - paediatric ecmo<sup>1</sup> 
- theoretical : intra-test variability reduced.

# Is anti-Xa monitoring better?

- Definition of 'better' 

> Better **efficacy** -- results in improved time in therapeutic range?

--

> Better **patient** outcomes -- safer/less complications ? 

--


> Better **provider** outcomes -- less monitoring/circuit change/dose change?

---
# Evaluation of anti-Xa monitoring: a pilot study
### Methodology
- single centre retrospective cohort review with electronic health records interrogation
- ?Ethics (service evaluation +/-)

--

### Opportunities
- Large volume centre
- COVID viral pneumonia(wave1&2) and previous flu pandemic : viral aetiology
- Timeframe : 01-01-2015 to 01-03-2021

--

### Clinical and Non-Clinical Outcomes
- Time to first therapeutic range, Time in therapeutic range
- Bleeding and Thrombotic Complications (e.g., Time to 1st complication)
- Frequency of prescription change (reduced workload on clinical team)

---
# Note on Data

# Heparin Prescription and Protocol

Heparin administered in 4 different formats 
- Heparin units/hour
- Heparin ECMO Xa infusion units/kg/hour
- Heparin IV Injection units
- Heparin RRT Inf 2000 iu units
- Heparin systemic inf 2000 units units/hour

--

-Thrombotic complications NOT available / included in this analysis.

-Bleeding complications extracted from EHR.

# Anticoagulation

- **NO GOLD** standard monitoring profile.


- Several solutions


> Time to first therapeutic range

> Time in therapeutic range (TTR)


- Most of the information from warfarin / dOAC monitoring.

# Time in therapeutic range defintions


| Method       | *Principle*     | Rosendaal            | Traditional            | Cross-sectional                       |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Numerator    | *Time in Range* | No of days in range  | No of in-range visits  | No of patients in range on last visit |
| Denominator  | *Total Time*    | Total Monitored Days | Total no of **visits** | Total no of **patients**              |
 

- Cross sectional method is not applicable to our population. 

- Traditional method assumes INR is static and binary (in or out of range).


- Rosendaal method(1993) assumes INR as dynamic but a **linear** progression between visits.
- Most studies do not mention method for calculating TTR.

# Time to First therapeutic Range (TFR) : Issues

- group assignment problem?

- 1st of November 2019 : **before** apttr monitoring and **after** axa monitoring.

- However, most patients have both apttr and axa sent.

> Likely early trial of anti Xa pre 1/Nov/2019.

- Even after 1st Nov 2019, axa monitoring may not be set (?)

- Some clinical team prefer apttr (?)

> large value of missing AXA value after 1/Nov/2019

> **DECISION** : Used a pragmatic approach.

# Missingness 1/2

- ** B I G ** topic in EHR analysis.

- Implicit vs. Explicit missing data.

- Explicit : declared as 'NONE' or 'NA' in the database.
- Implicit : simply not present.

# Missingness 2/2 

Truth  1: Patient X, 3 days on VV-ECMO, 3 anti-Xa checks, 6 APTTR checks 

Dataframe

| Patient | Timestamp    | anti Xa value | apttr value |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| X       | day 1 AM     | 0.5           | 1.5         |
| X       | day 1 PM     | NA            | 1.7         |
| X       | day 2 AM     | 0.6           | 1.4         |
| X       | ... day 3 PM | NA            | 1.5         |

vs. 

Truth : Patient X predominantly monitored on apttr but have occassional AXA checks

# Next Steps WITH current data- 1/2 

- Complete my analysis.`r emo::ji("smile")`

- Missing data needs cross-checking and perhaps re-extracting. e.g., 2 blood values with same time stamp.

- Need input from clinician (i.e., you) on what is appropriate. 

- Need further information on an existing patient popn 

> e.g., thrombotic complications, complete haemorrhagic complications, 

- Other approaches (e.g., Bland-Altman) to interrogate bias in assay measurements.

---

# Next Steps WITH MORE data - 2/2 

- Further variables on patient information : 
    - ethnicity / gender / renal function / other Rx e.g., aspirin / Past medical history
    - SOFA score at admission / Hb/ plts
    - no of red cells / platelets transfused 

- Circuit information?
    - Historical circuit stock e.g., MAHAM/NO doped circuits?
    - circuit change frequencies

- Proposal to expand patient popn to e.g., 31st Dec 2021

---
# Ambition and Discussion


- Expand to ecmo popn OR general ICU popn
> Risk : minimal as easily scaleable, potentially messier data with more heterogeneous popn.
> Benefits : larger volume. 

- Inference of variables associated with outcomes
> Risks vs. benefits as per above. 

- Prediction of 'optimal' dosing (e.g., via app )
> Risks : prediction / validation / app development pipeline

- Validation with other centre data - e.g., Brompton ? 
> Risks : access to data
> Benefits : potentially multi-centre data.
