# Anticoagulation in ECMO 

- Extra corporeal therapies - > anticoagulation. 
- GSTT - a large volume severe respiratory failure centre providing predominant VV-ECMO service. 
- Bleeding and thrombotic complications during ECMO are NOT uncommon. 
- __Multiple options__ : Activated Clotting Time (ACT), Activated Partial Thromboplastic time (aPTT),anti-factor Xa (Anti-Xa),prothrombin time and internationalised normal ratio (PT/INR)
--
<br>
<br>
<br>
- __apTT vs aXa__ ? 
- factor VIII, fibrinogen, lupus anticoagulant, acute phase reactants affect apTT
- Research challenging : due to low volume.
- small signal aXa may be a superior correlate - paediatric ecmo<sup>1</sup>

# Is anti-Xa monitoring better?

- Definition of 'better' 

> Better efficacy -- results in improved time in therapeutic range?

--

> Better patient outcomes -- safer/less complications ? 

--


> Better provider outcomes -- less monitoring/circuit change/dose change?

---
# Evaluation of anti-Xa monitoring: a pilot study
### Methodology
- single centre retrospective cohort review with electronic health records interrogation
- ?Ethics (service evaluation +/-)

--

### Opportunities
- Large volume centre
- COVID viral pneumonia(wave1&2) and previous flu pandemic : viral aetiology
- Timeframe : 01-01-2015 to 01-03-2021

--

### Clinical and Non-Clinical Outcomes
- Time to first therapeutic range, Time in therapeutic range
- Bleeding and Thrombotic Complications (e.g., Time to 1st complication)
- Frequency of prescription change (reduced workload on clinical team)

---
# Note on Data

Q1. Are there other anticoag used?

> A1. No (only heparin)


Q2. Ecmo run time used as gold standard?

> A2. Yes


Q3. No repeat ecmo runs?

> A3. Yes

Q4. Peak ecmo cannulations - 3 in 24 hours?

> A4. Yes covid. 


Q5. Data source?

> A5. EHR heparin prescription, anti-Xa and APTTR results, complications.

# Heparin Prescription and Protocol

Heparin administered in 4 different formats 
- Heparin units/hour
- Heparin ECMO Xa infusion units/kg/hour
- Heparin IV Injection units
- Heparin RRT Inf 2000 iu units
- Heparin systemic inf 2000 units units/hour

--

-Thrombotic complications NOT available / included in this analysis.

-Bleeding complications extracted from EHR.

Age : median age is very similar across cohorts.

Mortality : wave 2 is higher but not statistically sig.

# Anticoagulation

- **NO GOLD** standard monitoring profile.


- Several solutions


> Time to first therapeutic range

> Time in therapeutic range (TTR)


- Most of the information from warfarin / dOAC monitoring.

# Time in therapeutic range defintions


| Method       | *Principle*     | Rosendaal            | Traditional            | Cross-sectional                       |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Numerator    | *Time in Range* | No of days in range  | No of in-range visits  | No of patients in range on last visit |
| Denominator  | *Total Time*    | Total Monitored Days | Total no of **visits** | Total no of **patients**              |
 

- Cross sectional method is not applicable to our population. 

- Traditional method assumes INR is static and binary (in or out of range).


- Rosendaal method(1993) assumes INR as dynamic but a **linear** progression between visits.
- Most studies do not mention method for calculating TTR.

- **some** encouraging skill that axa patient are in better range.

- **signal** seems preserved.

# Time to first therapeutic range

- group assignment problem?

- 1st of November 2019 : **before** apttr monitoring and **after** axa monitoring.

- However, most patients have both apttr and axa sent.

- Likely early trial pre 1/Nov/2019.

- Even after 1st Nov 2019, axa monitoring may not be set (?)

- Some clinical team prefer apttr (?)

- large value of missing AXA value after 1/Nov/2019

# Missingess

- ** B I G ** topic in EHR analysis.

- Implicit vs. Explicit missing data.

- Explicit : declared as 'NONE' or 'NA' in the database.

- Implicit : simply not present.

- Water?
- NO water, thus - an empty cup.

# Next Steps- 1/2 

- Complete my analysis.`r emo::ji("smile")`

- Missing data needs cross-checking and perhaps re-extracting. e.g., 2 blood values with same time stamp.

- Need further information on an existing patient popn 
> thrombotic complications, complete haemorrhagic complications, 

- Proposal to expand patient popn to e.g., 31st Dec 2021

- Further variables on patient such as ethnicity / gender / kidney function / other Rx such as aspirin / Past medical history
- SOFA score / Hb/ platelet count/ units of bloods transfused/ circuit change data.

- Historical circuit stock e.g., MAHAM/NO doped circuits?

- Bland-Altman approach to interrogate bias in assay measurements.

---

# Next Steps - 2/2 

---
# Ambition and Discussion

- Trial at other centre - e.g., Brompton ? 

- Expand to ecmo popn OR general ICU popn

- Inference of variables associated with outcomes

- Prediction of 'optimal' dosing (e.g., via app )
