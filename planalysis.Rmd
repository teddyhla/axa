## Source of Data

This document details the data cleaning and pre-liminary analysis of anti Xa measurements on VV ecmo patients. 

Three cohorts of VV ecmo patients are identified :- 
- wave 1 of covid - 19, defined as between 01-03-2020 to 31-08-2020 inclusive.
- wave 2 of covid - 19, defined as between 01-09-2020 to 01-03-2021 inclusive.
- historical flu, defined as 01-01-2015 and 31-12-2019 inclusive. 

## Questions
- what about non covid and non flu patients in this period?
- what about large gaps - is it true?
- what about lmwh / flolan / argotraban ? 
- mrn 6960892X as admission date = as discharge date ? typo

## Sensecheck 
- no repeat admissions?
- peak 3 ecmo admission in 24 hour ?


## Patient identification
- ecmo blood pump speed was calculated from min to max dates and substracted to get ecmo run times and patients

## Heparin administration
Heparin was administered in 4 different formats 
- heparin units/hr
- heparin ecmo xa iv infusion units/kg/hr
- heparin iv injection units
- heprin rrt inf 2000 iu units
- heparin systemic inf 2000 units units/hr

weight is also extracted to calculate units/hr/hr 

## Coagulation lab results
- anti Xa and APTTR results were extracted

## Bleeding scores are extracted from ICIP.
