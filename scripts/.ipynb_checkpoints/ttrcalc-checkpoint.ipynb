    "# Time in Therapeutic Range - Rosendaal Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Time in therapeutic range is a commonly used mareker of quality control for I suppose any drugs but mainly anticoagulants. Literature mentions several approaches and debate around what is the best method to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly used methods are traditional approach : no of in-range blood tests divided by total no of blood tests. \n",
    "This method has flaws as time between blood tests are not treated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a patient P, who receive INR blood tests in a certain time period with values as : \n",
    "\n",
    "time 1 , INR value 1\n",
    "\n",
    "time 2, INR value 2 \n",
    "\n",
    "time 3 , INR value 3 \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional method for this patient P ,TTRtrad = no of in-range / 3 \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional method is not robust to handle with situations such as below :- \n",
    "\n",
    "target INR 2-3\n",
    "\n",
    "day 1, INR 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "day 2, INR 5.0\n",
    "\n",
    "day 3, INR 1.0 \n",
    "\n",
    "According to traditional method, this patient would have 0 time in therapeutic range as none of the recorded blood values are in-range, thus 0/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, Rosendaal(1993) has made an improvement on this traditional method by using a linter interpolation between two set of blood values.  Therefore,under Rosendaal, a straight line (lm) is plotted between time1,value1 and time2,value 2 (i.e., linear interpolation). Therefore, in the above scenario, patient real-world INR must move between 1.0 to 5.0 in between day 1 and day 2's tests. Although at time t1 with INR 1.0 is below the range, the patient must have time 't' where it is in range to achieve INR 5.0 on time t2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The days in monitored are two days : i.e., between interval begining on day 1 at blood draw with resultant INR 1.0 and interval end on day 3 at INR 1.0 again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, according to Rosendaal method, TTRrosendaal would be = 0.5 days. \n",
    "\n",
    "(add graph to easily comprehend this).\n",

    "### Unfortunately, no easy code or package available in R or Python. \n",
