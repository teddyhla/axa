## 1.1. Creating a dataframe 'checkdf' to explore duration of lab values ----

###We need to explore NA and their impact on data. Whether there is a pattern?
### The data range of each patient should correspond to ecmo run times.
### In the absence, we will use ecmo run time as gold standard.
### We will use day instead of individual second/ hour difference for clinical impact. 

labdur <- lab %>%

                labd = max(dtmd)-min(dtmd)
        )
#labdur is a df  where you can find out when blood results begin to available and last blood results recorded.
#this is enriched with further info on run times, cohort,etc to create a checkdf 
checkdf <- full_join(
        labdur,
        pt %>% select(mrn,ecmorunt,datecannulated,dateDEcannulated,cohort),
        by = "mrn"
)
tdiff <- checkdf$ecmorunt - checkdf$labd
#this showed that patient duration is shorter than lab duration.

# could it be that lab counts the date admission to date discharge from icu ?
# but pt dur shouldnt be longer than lab duration (which suggests missing data in lab)
sum(checkdf$ecmorunt - checkdf$labd > 0)
checkdf[(checkdf$ecmorunt - checkdf$labd >0 ),]
#looking at this data frame looks like there is only one or two discrepancy for most cases as you would expect toelrance of 1 or 2 days either way.

#except 6381359H (missing data 3 days on blood but towards the end so shouldnt be a proble,
#),6855512Y(missing data 2/3 days pre),
rm(tdiff,labdur)

## 1.2.  Creation of clean lab values 'clab' s which have tolerance of 1 +/- of ecmo run times ----

#now we will look at NA's within those ranges. 
#lets make new columns where we give a tolerance of +1 or -1 day of ecmo duration.

        group_by (mrn) %>% 
        filter (dtm >= dateprecan & dtm <dateDEplus1) %>% 
        ungroup()
#clab is a dataframe where blood values are subsetted by ecmo duration +1 day pre ecmo and 1 day post ecmo.
#then we will find out how much NA's there are.
#this reduces to 9280 entries from 12309 entries

#lets make sense of this NA value by appending cohort information.
## 1.3.a. Creating 'clabna' dataframe to explore missingness ----

#visdat::vis_dat(clab) #showed that the missingness of AXA and APTTR are not random.

clabna<- clab %>% 
        select(mrn,axa,apttr,cohort,dtm,ecmorunt)%>%

        ) 
#this is a dataframe where we explore NA values for both apttr and axa in clean lab values.

message("04_ lab cleaned to create 'clab' and 'clabna'.")
#let's explore maximum , median, mean, and minimum NA's per axa apttr in each pt.

# we need to adjust missing data per ecmo run times.

# histogram of ecmoruntimes showed a median run time of 13 days.
#histogram of number of lab results showed a median of 34 days.
# thus dividing median by median results = 34/13 = 2.6 blood draws per day.
#so if there is a missing data but it is still less than 2.6 blood draws per day than its ok.
# this may not be correct as axa monitoring may require less blood draws.

#note 1st Nov 2019 is where we switch.

#manual inspection  of the data verified missing data for APTTR is acceptable for flu cohort.
# manual inspection of the data for AXA

#NOTE although axa is demarcated from 1st november - 5th november cannulation is still using apttr
### 1.3.b. Creating 'clabna2' which showed patients in axa monitoring group but really uses apttr.-----

clabna2 <- clabna[,c("mrn","no_lab","na_axa","erunt","cohort","datecannulated","missingaxa","na_apttr")]
clabna2 <- clabna2 %>% filter(missingaxa < 1 & cohort != "Flu")

#all true here 
# some consultants prefer apttr?


## 1.4. Appending 'clab' with columns - axarange and apttrrange for whether axa apttr by range status ----
#now lets make a column where we label in and out of range for apttr and axa, bearing in mind PE patients.

#this code showed that patients with PE have MRN 6513466R, and 6584394E.

## 1.5. Appending 'clab' with day on ecmo 'ecmo_day' column  ----

#let's create a day on ecmo column to append to each row.

## 1.6. Appending 'clab' with column 'g' to designate monitoring group -----

#lets think about assigning group.

# Several ways of assigning groups 



### 1.6.a. Using a simple definition ----

#axa monitoring was established on 1 Nov 2019. Thus any date before should be apttr and those after would be axa. 

clab$g1 <- ifelse(clab$datecannulated < as.Date("2019-11-01"),"apt","axa")
clab$g1 <- as.factor(clab$g1)

#clab %>% count(g1,mrn) %>% summary() 
# this showed that there is 72 people apt and 129 in axa groups.

### 1.6.b. Using a sophisticated definition -----

#to do this we need to review the clabna df.

# "6776201S" - date of cannulation 2019-11-12 is in apt monitoring group as large missing values in axa but its only 50% so could 
#axa doesnt require that much monitoring.

# 6771817W from 11-05 however has 90% missing and therefore should be for apt.
#thus cut off should be 2019 11 06.

# "5277619S","6852899A","6860416Y","6851184E" wave 1 patient so thought in axa group they hve no axa measured. 
# "6950251Z","6956232H","6935380E","6968816C" wave 2 patients who have more apt than axa monitoring.

clab$g2 <- ifelse(clab$datecannulated < as.Date ("2019-11-06"),"apt","axa")
reassign1 <- c("5277619S","6852899A","6860416Y","6851184E","6950251Z","6956232H","6935380E","6968816C")

#cplab[cplab$mrn %in% reassign_group_70p,]$group <- "apt"

clab[clab$mrn %in% reassign1,]$g2 <- "apt"
clab$g2 <- as.factor(clab$g2)

# now there is 81 in apt group and 120 in axa group. 


## 1.7.a. Creating a new df 'dfg1p' that measure time to first in range for monitoring group 'g1' ----

# Now let's count the first time axa/apt get in range using g1 definitions.
