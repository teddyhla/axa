# 1.0. RATIONALE ---------------------------------------------------------------

#Exploring differences in blood product requirements between axa and apttr groups
#Assumptions 1: blood products given in "units". Thus, units treated as "integers"

#Assumptions 2: decision for blood products usually made slowly(i.e., time-insensitive) OR
#rapidly "time-sensitive". 
#"Time-sensitive" are likely to be major haemorrhage OR mass transfusions 
#"Time-insensitive" means that decision for transfusion and physical transfusion
#is enacted much slower. 
#Therefore "a calendar day" is decided as unit of time.
#This is due to unnecessary complication of rules for exact 24 hour from blood product
#and the blood test values before the 24 hour mark or say at 6 hour mark. 
#we will do further testing to declare fitness of this.
