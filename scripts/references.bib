	abstract = {Abstract
            During extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}), a delicate balance is required to titrate systemic anticoagulation to prevent thrombotic complications within the circuit and prevent bleeding in the patient. Despite focused efforts to achieve this balance, the frequency of both thrombotic and bleeding events remains high. Anticoagulation is complicated to manage in this population due to the complexities of the hemostatic system that are compounded by age-related developmental hemostatic changes, variable effects of the etiology of critical illness on hemostasis, and blood-circuit interaction. Lack of high-quality data to guide anticoagulation management in {ECMO} patients results in marked practice variability among centers. One aspect of anticoagulation therapy that is particularly challenging is the use of antithrombin ({AT}) supplementation for heparin resistance. This is especially controversial in the neonatal and pediatric population due to the baseline higher risk of bleeding in this cohort. The indication for {AT} supplementation is further compounded by the potential inaccuracy of the diagnosis of heparin resistance based on the standard laboratory parameters used to assess heparin effect. With concerns regarding the adverse impact of bleeding and thrombosis, clinicians and institutions are faced with making difficult, real-time decisions aimed at optimizing anticoagulation in this setting. In this clinically focused review, the authors discuss the complexities of anticoagulation monitoring and therapeutic intervention for patients on {ECMO} and examine the challenges surrounding {AT} supplementation given both the historical and current perspectives summarized in the literature on these topics.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {\textbackslash}Anticoagulation is used for stroke prophylaxis in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, amongst other by use of the vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. Quality in warfarin therapy is often summarized by the time patients spend within the therapeutic range (percent time in therapeutic range, {TTR}). The correlation between {TTR} and the occurrence of complications during warfarin therapy has been established, but the influence of patient characteristics in that respect remains undetermined. The objective of the present papers was to examine the association between mean {TTR} and complication rates with adjustment for differences in relevant patient cohort characteristics.
{METHODS}: A systematic literature search was conducted in {MEDLINE} and Embase (2005-2015) to identify eligible studies reporting on use of warfarin therapy by patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and the occurrence of hemorrhage and thromboembolism. Both randomized controlled trials and observational cohort studies were included. The association between the reported mean {TTR} and major bleeding and stroke/systemic embolism was analyzed by random-effects meta-regression with and without adjustment for relevant clinical cohort characteristics. In the adjusted meta-regressions, the impact of mean {TTR} on the occurrence of hemorrhage was adjusted for the mean age and the proportion of populations with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. In the adjusted analyses on thromboembolism, the proportion of females was, furthermore, included.
{RESULTS}: Of 2169 papers, 35 papers met pre-specified inclusion criteria, holding relevant information on 31 patient cohorts. In univariable meta-regression, increasing mean {TTR} was significantly associated with a decreased rate of both major bleeding and stroke/systemic embolism. However, after adjustment mean {TTR} was no longer significantly associated with stroke/systemic embolism. The proportion of residual variance composed by between-study heterogeneity was substantial for all analyses.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Although higher mean {TTR} in warfarin therapy was associated with lower complication rates in atrial fibrillation, the strength of the association was decreased when adjusting for differences in relevant clinical characteristics of the patient cohorts. This study suggests that mainly the safety of warfarin therapy increases with higher mean {TTR}, whereas effectiveness appears not to be substantially improved. Due to the limitations immanent in the meta-regression methods, the results of the present study should be interpreted with caution. Further research on the association between the quality of warfarin therapy and risk of complications is warranted with adjustment for clinically relevant characteristics.},

	abstract = {Time in therapeutic range ({TTR}), a well-recognized performance metric of oral anticoagulation, measures the time when patients' international normalized ratios ({INRs}) are within the desired range. The {TTR} value can vary significantly depending on the type of method used and can be a skewed indicator of the overall quality of anticoagulation. As such, the present study was designed to compare three methods for {TTR} calculation (cross-sectional, traditional, and Rosendaal) to quantify their differences, biases, and trends. As part of this investigation, a 21-week retrospective analysis of patients on warfarin was conducted to compare {TTR} values obtained by these three methods. Paired t-tests, correlation studies between size and bias, and Bland-Altman plots were performed using {SAS} 9.4 ({SAS} Institute, Cary, {NC}, {USA}). It was revealed that the {TTR} values for the cross-sectional, Rosendaal, and traditional methods were 65.97, 58.12, and 51.55, respectively. The addition of tolerances to {INR} ranges of ± 0.2 and ± 0.5 increased {TTR} values to 81.79 and 91.53, respectively, for the cross-sectional method, and 66.86 and 82.69, respectively, for the traditional method. The use of the traditional method resulted in significantly higher {TTR} values than did use of the Rosendaal method, with high variability between the methods in both positive and negative directions. There was a demonstrated lack of independence between the methods, and zero bias could not be assumed. In conclusion, the different methods considered in the present study do not accurately measure whether a patient is in or out of the therapeutic range, and the addition of tolerances can further distort the perception of anticoagulation achieved. We recommend a standardized {TTR} calculation method as well as a uniform tolerance for use in clinical trials and quality control efforts.},

	abstract = {Background
Bleeding is the most frequent complication associated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}) support in critically ill patients. Nonetheless, risk factors for bleeding have been poorly described especially those associated with coagulation anomalies and anticoagulant therapy during {ECMO} support. The aim of this study is to describe bleeding complications in critically ill patients undergoing {ECMO} and to identify risk factors for bleeding events.

Methods
We retrospectively analysed {ICU} charts of adults who received either veno-venous ({VV}) or veno-arterial ({VA}) {ECMO} support in two participating {ICUs} between 2010 and 2013. Characteristics of patients with and without bleeding complications, as per the Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation ({ELSO}) definition, were compared, and the impact of bleeding complications on patient outcomes was assessed using survival analysis. Variables that were independently associated with bleeding, including daily clinical and biological variables during {ECMO} courses, were modelled.

Results
Of the 149 {ECMO} episodes (111 {VA} {ECMO} and 38 {VV} {ECMO}) performed in 147 adults, 89 episodes (60 \%) were complicated by at least one bleeding event. The most common bleeding sources were: {ECMO} cannula (37 \%), haemothorax or cardiac tamponade (17 \%) and ear–nose and throat (16 \%). Intra-cranial haemorrhage occurred in five (2.2 \%) patients. Bleeding complications were independently associated with worse survival [adjusted hazard ratio ({HR}) 2.17, 95 \% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.07–4.41, P = 0.03]. Higher activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}) [adjusted odds ratio ({OR}) 3.00, 95 \% {CI} 1.64–5.47, P {\textless} 0.01], {APACHE} {III} score [adjusted {OR} 1.01, 95 \% {CI} 1.01–1.02, P = 0.01] and {ECMO} following surgery [adjusted {OR} 3.04, 95 \% {CI} 1.62–5.69, P {\textless} 0.01] were independently associated with greater risk of bleeding occurrence. A similar association between bleeding and higher {aPTT} was found when non-post-surgical {VA} {ECMO} was considered separately.

Conclusions
Bleeding events based on the {ELSO} bleeding definition occurred in more than 60 \% of {ECMO} episodes and were associated with hospital mortality. We identified higher {aPTT} prior bleeding as an independent risk factor for bleeding event, suggesting that better control of the {aPTT} (through a better control of either coagulopathy or anticoagulation) may improve patients’ outcome.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Personalized warfarin dosing is influenced by various factors including genetic and non-genetic factors. Multiple linear regression ({LR}) is known as a conventional method to develop predictive models. Recently, machine learning approaches have been extensively implemented for warfarin dosing due to the hypothesis of non-linear association between covariates and stable warfarin dose.
{OBJECTIVE}: To extend the multiple linear regression algorithm for personalized warfarin dosing in a Korean population and compare with a machine learning--based algorithm.
{METHOD}: From this cohort study, we collected information on 650 patients taking warfarin who achieved steady state including demographic information, indications, comorbidities, comedications, habits, and genetic factors. The dataset was randomly split into training set (90\%) and test set (10\%). The {LR} and machine learning (gradient boosting machine [{GBM}]) models were developed on the training set and were evaluated on the test set.
{RESULT}: {LR} and {GBM} models were comparable in terms of accuracy of ideal dose (75.38\% and 73.85\%), correlation (0.77 and 0.73), mean absolute error (0.58 mg/day and 0.64 mg/day), and root mean square error (0.82 mg/day and 0.9 mg/day), respectively. {VKORC}1 genotype, {CYP}2C9 genotype, age, and weight were the highest contributors and could obtain 80\% of maximum performance in both models.
{CONCLUSION}: This study shows that our {LR} and {GMB} models are satisfactory to predict warfarin dose in our dataset. Both models showed similar performance and feature contribution characteristics. {LR} may be the appropriate model due to its simplicity and interpretability.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Unfractionated heparin is widely used in the intensive care unit as an anticoagulant. However, weight-based heparin dosing has been shown to be suboptimal and may place patients at unnecessary risk during their intensive care unit stay.
{OBJECTIVE}: In this study, we intended to develop and validate a machine learning-based model to predict heparin treatment outcomes and to provide dosage recommendations to clinicians.
{METHODS}: A shallow neural network model was adopted in a retrospective cohort of patients from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care {III} ({MIMIC} {III}) database and patients admitted to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital ({PUMCH}). We modeled the subtherapeutic, normal, and supratherapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}) as the outcomes of heparin treatment and used a group of clinical features for modeling. Our model classifies patients into 3 different therapeutic states. We tested the prediction ability of our model and evaluated its performance by using accuracy, the kappa coefficient, precision, recall, and the F1 score. Furthermore, a dosage recommendation module was designed and evaluated for clinical decision support.
{RESULTS}: A total of 3607 patients selected from {MIMIC} {III} and 1549 patients admitted to the {PUMCH} who met our criteria were included in this study. The shallow neural network model showed results of F1 scores 0.887 ({MIMIC} {III}) and 0.925 ({PUMCH}). When compared with the actual dosage prescribed, our model recommended increasing the dosage for 72.2\% ({MIMIC} {III}, 1240/1718) and 64.7\% ({PUMCH}, 281/434) of the subtherapeutic patients and decreasing the dosage for 80.9\% ({MIMIC} {III}, 504/623) and 76.7\% ({PUMCH}, 277/361) of the supratherapeutic patients, suggesting that the recommendations can contribute to clinical improvements and that they may effectively reduce the time to optimal dosage in the clinical setting.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The evaluation of our model for predicting heparin treatment outcomes demonstrated that the developed model is potentially applicable for reducing the misdosage of heparin and for providing appropriate decision recommendations to clinicians.},

The neural network was trained using {PT}-{INR} measurements within days 0-30 after starting treatment and clinical outcomes over days 31-365 in a derivation cohort (cohorts 1-3; n = 3185). Accuracy of the {AI} model at predicting major bleed, stroke/systemic embolism ({SE}), and death was assessed in a validation cohort (cohorts 4-5; n = 1523). The model's c-statistic for predicting major bleed, stroke/{SE}, and all-cause death was 0.75, 0.70, and 0.61, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Using serial {PT}-{INR} values collected within 1 month after starting {VKA}, the new {AI} model performed better than time in therapeutic range at predicting clinical outcomes occurring up to 12 months thereafter. Serial {PT}-{INR} values contain important information that can be analysed by computer to help predict adverse clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Warfarin dosing remains challenging due to narrow therapeutic index and highly individual variability. Incorrect warfarin dosing is associated with devastating adverse events. Remarkable efforts have been made to develop the machine learning based warfarin dosing algorithms incorporating clinical factors and genetic variants such as polymorphisms in {CYP}2C9 and {VKORC}1. The most widely validated pharmacogenetic algorithm is the {IWPC} algorithm based on multivariate linear regression ({MLR}). However, with only a single algorithm, the prediction performance may reach an upper limit even with optimal parameters. Here, we present novel algorithms using stacked generalization frameworks to estimate the warfarin dose, within which different types of machine learning algorithms function together through a meta-machine learning model to maximize the prediction accuracy. Compared to the {IWPC}-derived {MLR} algorithm, Stack 1 and 2 based on stacked generalization frameworks performed significantly better overall. Subgroup analysis revealed that the mean of the percentage of patients whose predicted dose of warfarin within 20\% of the actual stable therapeutic dose (mean percentage within 20\%) for Stack 1 was improved by 12.7\% (from 42.47\% to 47.86\%) in Asians and by 13.5\% (from 22.08\% to 25.05\%) in the low-dose group compared to that for {MLR}, respectively. These data suggest that our algorithms would especially benefit patients requiring low warfarin maintenance dose, as subtle changes in warfarin dose could lead to adverse clinical events (thrombosis or bleeding) in patients with low dose. Our study offers novel pharmacogenetic algorithms for clinical trials and practice.},

	abstract = {Anticoagulation response to warfarin during the initial stage of therapy varies among individuals. In this study, we aimed to combine pharmacometabolomic and pharmacogenetic data to predict interindividual variation in warfarin response, and, on this basis, suggest an initial daily dose range. The baseline metabolic profiles, genotypes, and clinical information of 160 patients with heart valve disease served as the variables of the function of the last international normalized ratio measured before a patient's discharge ({INRday}7 ) to screen for potential biomarkers. The partial least-squares model showed that two baseline metabolites (uridine and guanosine), one single-nucleotide variation ({VKORC}1), and four clinical parameters (weight, creatinine level, amiodarone usage, and initial daily dose) had good predictive power for {INRday}7 (R2  = 0.753 for the training set, 0.643 for the test set). With these biomarkers, a machine learning algorithm (two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis-multinomial logit model) was used to predict the subgroups with extremely warfarin-sensitive or less warfarin-sensitive patients with a prediction accuracy of 91\% for the training set and 90\% for the test set, indicating that individual responses to warfarin could be effectively predicted. Based on this model, we have successfully designed an algorithm,"{IniWarD}," for predicting an effective dose range in the initial 7-day warfarin therapy. The results indicate that the daily dose range suggested by the {IniWarD} system is more appropriate than that of the conventional genotype-based method, and the risk of bleeding or thrombus due to warfarin could thus be avoided.},

The development cohort included 364 patients recruited from eight outpatient clinics and hospital departments in Uganda and South Africa (June 2018-July 2019). Validation was conducted using an external validation cohort (270 patients recruited from August 2019 to March 2020 in 12 outpatient clinics and hospital departments). Based on the mean absolute error ({MAE}; mean of absolute differences between the actual and predicted doses), random forest regression (12.07 mg/week; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 10.39-13.76) was the best performing machine-learning technique in the external validation cohort, whereas the worst performing technique was model trees (17.59 mg/week; 95\% {CI}, 15.75-19.43). By comparison, the simple, commonly used regression technique (ordinary least squares) performed similarly to more complex supervised machine-learning techniques and achieved an {MAE} of 13.01 mg/week (95\% {CI}, 11.45-14.58). In summary, we have demonstrated that simpler regression techniques perform similarly to more complex supervised machine-learning techniques. We have also externally validated our previously developed clinical dose-initiation algorithm, which is being prospectively tested for clinical utility.},

	shorttitle = {Can Machine Learning from Real-World Data Support Drug Treatment Decisions?},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Decision making for the "best" treatment is particularly challenging in situations in which individual patient response to drugs can largely differ from average treatment effects. By estimating individual treatment effects ({ITEs}), we aimed to demonstrate how strokes, major bleeding events, and a composite of both could be reduced by model-assisted recommendations for a particular direct oral anticoagulant ({DOAC}).
{METHODS}: In German claims data for the calendar years 2014-2018, we selected 29 901 new users of the {DOACs} rivaroxaban and apixaban. Random forests considered binary events within 1 y to estimate {ITEs} under each {DOAC} according to the X-learner algorithm with 29 potential effect modifiers; treatment recommendations were based on these estimated {ITEs}. Model performance was evaluated by the c-for-benefit statistics, absolute risk reduction ({ARR}), and absolute risk difference ({ARD}) by trial emulation.
{RESULTS}: A significant proportion of patients would be recommended a different treatment option than they actually received. The stroke model significantly discriminated patients for higher benefit and thus indicated improved decisions by reduced outcomes (c-for-benefit: 0.56; 95\% confidence interval [0.52; 0.60]). In the group with apixaban recommendation, the model also improved the composite endpoint ({ARR}: 1.69 \% [0.39; 2.97]). In trial emulations, model-assisted recommendations significantly reduced the composite event rate ({ARD}: -0.78 \% [-1.40; -0.03]).
{CONCLUSIONS}: If prescribers are undecided about the potential benefits of different treatment options, {ITEs} can support decision making, especially if evidence is inconclusive, risk-benefit profiles of therapeutic alternatives differ significantly, and the patients' complexity deviates from "typical" study populations. In the exemplary case for {DOACs} and potentially in other situations, the significant impact could also become practically relevant if recommendations were available in an automated way as part of decision making.{HighlightsIt} was possible to calculate individual treatment effects ({ITEs}) from routine claims data for rivaroxaban and apixaban, and the characteristics between the groups with recommendation for one or the other option differed significantly.{ITEs} resulted in recommendations that were significantly superior to usual (observed) treatment allocations in terms of absolute risk reduction, both separately for stroke and in the composite endpoint of stroke and major bleeding.When similar patients from routine data were selected (precision cohorts) for patients with a strong recommendation for one option or the other, those similar patients under the respective recommendation showed a significantly better prognosis compared with the alternative option.Many steps may still be needed on the way to clinical practice, but the principle of decision support developed from routine data may point the way toward future decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: The activated partial thromboplastin time ({APTT}) is commonly used to monitor unfractionated heparin ({UFH}) but may not accurately measure the amount of heparin present. The anti-Xa assay is less susceptible to confounding factors and may be a better assay for this purpose.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: The validity of the {APTT} for monitoring {UFH} was assessed by comparing with an anti-Xa assay on 3543 samples from 475 patients (infants [n=165], children 1-15years [n=60] and adults [n=250]) receiving treatment dose {UFH}.
{RESULTS}: Overall concordance was poor. The highest concordance (66\%; 168/254) was seen in children. Concordance (51.8\%) or discordance (48.4\%) was almost equal in adult patients. Among adult patients whose anti-Xa level was within 0.3-0.7IU/{mL}, only 38\% had an {APTT} in the therapeutic range whilst 56\% were below and 6\% were above therapeutic range. Children and adult patients with anti-Xa of 0.3-0.7IU/{mL} but sub- therapeutic {APTT} had significantly higher fibrinogen levels compared to those with therapeutic or supra-therapeutic {APTT}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: When the anti-Xa level was 0.3-0.7IU/{mL}, the majority of samples from infants demonstrated a supra-therapeutic {APTT}, whilst adults tended to have a sub-therapeutic {APTT}. This may lead to under anticoagulation in infants or over anticoagulation in adults with risk of bleeding if {APTT} is used to monitor {UFH}. These results further strengthen existing evidence of the limitation of {APTT} in monitoring {UFH}. Discordance of {APTT} and anti-Xa level in adults and children may be due to elevation of fibrinogen level.},

We aimed to explore the role of anti-factor Xa levels in optimizing the high-intensity anticoagulation?s safety and efficacy and finding possible associations between D-dimer levels, cytokine storm markers, and {COVID}-19-induced coagulopathy or thrombophilia.Methods:Retrospective cohort study conducted on 69 critically ill {COVID}-19 patients who received three regimens of higher intensity anticoagulation.Results:Seventeen patients (24.6\%) received high-dose enoxaparin prophylaxis, 29 patients (42\%) received therapeutic doses of enoxaparin, and 23 patients (33.3\%) were on therapeutic unfractionated heparin infusion. Fewer than one-third of the whole cohort (n?=?22; 31.8\%) achieved the target range of anti-factor Xa. The patients were divided into three subgroups based on anti-factor Xa target status within each anticoagulation regimen; when compared, the only association observed among them was for interleukin-6 levels, which were significantly higher in both the ?above the expected range? and ?below the expected range? groups compared with the ?within the expected range? group (p?=?0.009). Major bleeding episodes occurred in 14 (20.3\%) patients and were non-significantly more frequent in the ?below the expected anti-factor Xa range group? (p?=?0.415). Seven patients (10.1\%) developed thrombosis. The majority of patients had anti-factor Xa levels below the expected ranges (four patients, 57.1\%).Conclusion:Conventional anti-factor Xa ranges may not be appropriate as a predictive surrogate for bleeding in critically ill {COVID}-19. The clinical decision to initiate therapeutic anticoagulation preemptively may be individualized according to thrombosis and bleeding risks. Cytokine storm markers, namely, interleukin-6, may play a role in {COVID}-19-induced coagulopathy or thrombophilia.},

In the ambulatory setting, clinicians who manage warfarin therapy often use time in the therapeutic range ({TTR}) to estimate a percentage of time the international normalized ratio is therapeutic. We applied the {TTR} concept to {aPTT} monitoring for therapeutic {UFH} and used 2 methodologies for estimation: percentage of {aPTT} values in range (\%{aIR}) and a modification of the Rosendaal method (mod-Rosendaal). This study included adult inpatients admitted between September 30, 2015, and September 30, 2016, at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. For each patient, all available {aPTT} values were extracted to calculate 2 individual {TTRs} according to each methodology. Comparison between methods was performed using Student t test, and correlation was assessed with simple linear regression. A total of 255 patients were included in this study. The major outcome of {TTR} estimation was significantly higher using mod-Rosendaal (43.7\% [26.5\%]) versus \%{aIR} (37.7\% [25.7\%], P = .012) by a mean difference of 6\% points (95\% confidence interval: 1.3-10.7). Time in the therapeutic range estimated by mod-Rosendaal significantly correlated with those estimated by \%{aIR} (r = 0.84, P {\textless} .001). Further studies should evaluate the correlation between {TTR} and clinical outcomes and establish a benchmark for quality therapeutic anticoagulation with continuous {UFH}.},

Auto-regressive, integrated, moving average ({ARIMA}) time-series modeling was used to determine how anticoagulation control changed in the peri-hospitalization period. The study included 5,380 elderly patients in Eastern Ontario between 1 September 1999 and 1 September 2000 taking {OACs}. Results showed that 951 (17.7\%) were hospitalized during their {OAC} therapy [thrombotic, n = 52 (1.0\%); hemorrhagic, n = 140 (2.6\%); other hospitalization types, n = 759 (14.1\%)]. All measures of anticoagulation control changed significantly in the peri-hospitalization period. Before hemorrhagic admissions, mean {INR} and proportion with {INR} {\textgreater} 5 increased significantly (daily increase 0.024, P = .03 and 0.2\%, P = .01). Following other hospitalization types, the proportion of patients with {INR} {\textless} 1.5 was significantly increased (daily increase 0.19\%, P = .02). Patients admitted to the hospital for a variety of indications have significantly worse anticoagulation control in the peri-hospitalization period.

Design Interrupted-time-series analysis quantifying anticoagulant dispensing, before and after first Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme ({PBS}) {NOAC} listing in August 2009 for venous thromboembolism prevention; and expanded listing for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation ({AF}) in August 2013, up to June 2016. Estimated government expenditure on {PBS}-listed anticoagulants. Setting and participants {PBS} dispensing in 10\% random sample of Australians, restricted to continuous concessional beneficiaries dispensed oral anticoagulants from July 2005 to June 2016. Total {PBS} anticoagulant expenditure was calculated using Medicare Australia statistics. Main outcome measures Monthly dispensing and initiation of oral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran or apixaban). Annual {PBS} anticoagulant expenditure. Results An estimated 149,180 concessional beneficiaries were dispensed anticoagulants (100\% warfarin) during July 2005. This increased to 292,550 during June 2016, of whom 47.0\%, 27.1\%, 18.7\% and 7.2\% were dispensed warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran, respectively. Of 16,500 initiated on anticoagulants in June 2016, 24.3\%, 38.2\%, 30.0\% and 7.5\% were initiated on warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran, respectively. Compared to July 2005-July 2013, from August 2013-June 2016, dispensings for all anticoagulants increased by 2,303 dispensings/month (p{\textless}0.001, 95\%{CI} = [1,229 3,376]); warfarin dispensing decreased by 1,803 dispensings/month (p{\textless}0.001, 95\%{CI} = [–2,606, –1,000]). Total {PBS} anticoagulant expenditure was \$19.5 million (97.0\% concessional) in 2008/09, of which 100\% was warfarin and \$203.3 million (86.2\% concessional) in 2015/16, of which 11.2\% was warfarin.

	abstract = {Objective
To investigate the predictive performance of machine learning ({ML}) algorithms for estimating anticoagulation control in patients with atrial fibrillation ({AF}) who are treated with warfarin.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients (≥18 years) between 2007 and 2016 using linked primary and secondary care data (Clinical Practice Research Datalink {GOLD} and Hospital Episode Statistics). Various {ML} techniques were explored to predict suboptimal anticoagulation control, defined as time in therapeutic range ({TTR}) {\textless} 70\% based on International Normalised Ratio ({INR}) 2.0–3.0. Baseline (linear and non-linear support vector machines; random forests; stochastic gradient boosting [{XGBoost}]; neural networks [{NN}]) and time-varying data (6-week intervals up to 30 weeks (long-short term memory [{LSTM}] {NN})) were applied. Patient records depicting unique lines of warfarin therapy ({LOT}) were separated into training (70\%) and holdout sets (30\%) for model training and testing, respectively.
Results
35,479 patients were eligible for inclusion, of whom 24,684 and 10,795 were assigned to the training (32,683 unique {LOTs}) and holdout sets (14,218 unique {LOTs}). Across all models, depression (diagnosis and/or prescription of antidepressant medication) was a significant driver in predicting anticoagulation control. At baseline, {XGBoost} was the best-performing model (area under the curve [{AUC}]: 0.624) due to its ability to identify non-linear associations such as age and weight (greater probability of suboptimal control: {\textless}65 and {\textgreater}80 years and {\textless}70 kg, respectively). Addition of time-varying data to the {LSTM} {NN} improved predictive performance, plateauing at {AUC} of 0.830 at 30 weeks.
Conclusion
{ML} algorithms displayed clinically useful ability to predict patients who are at greater risk of suboptimal control. The addition of time-varying data to the algorithm, especially prior {INR} measurements, improved predictive performance. These algorithms provide improved predictive tools for identifying patients who may benefit from more frequent {INR} monitoring or switching to alternative therapies.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Studies have shown that achieving a time in therapeutic range ({TTR}) for warfarin of greater than 60\% is associated with a lower risk of bleeding. However, many patients on hemodialysis ({HD}) do not achieve this target.
Methods
We audited {TTR} achievement at the in-center {HD} unit of our hospital in 2017 and found that only 40\% of patients had achieved a {TTR} {\textgreater}60\%. We aimed to improve the percentage of {HD} patients achieving target {TTR} within 2 years. We reported each patient's individualized trend in quarterly {TTR} to their primary warfarin prescriber as an audit-feedback report. These reports were generated, disseminated, and subsequently improved following a series of plan-do-study-act cycles. We then used statistical process control to assess for changes in the percentage of {HD} patients achieving target {TTR} over time.
Results
In the primary analysis, 28 patients were included in the baseline period, and 46 were included in the intervention period. At baseline, the percentage of patients achieving a {TTR} {\textgreater}60\% varied between 33\% and 45\% (mean ± {SD}, 40\% ± 5\%); post-intervention, this metric improved and varied between 52\% and 71\% (mean ± {SD}, 61\% ± 8\%). In time-series analysis, there was evidence of statistically significant variation between the 2 periods and evidence of sustained improvement.
Conclusions
A quality improvement program consisting of an audit-feedback report that raises awareness of the quality gap in {TTR} achievement can result in substantial improvement in the safe and efficacious administration of warfarin to patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis.},

	abstract = {Background—Among patients receiving warfarin, percent time in therapeutic range ({TTR}) and international normalized ratio ({INR}) variability predict adverse events individually. Here, we examined what is added to the prediction of adverse events by using both measures together.
Methods and Results—We included 40 404 patients anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation, aged 65+, within the Veterans Health Administration. {TTR} and log-transformed {INR} variability were calculated for each patient. Our study outcomes were ischemic stroke and major bleeding, defined using International Classification of Diseases-9 codes. We estimated the hazard ratios ({HRs}) for the study outcomes using 3 nested Cox regression models, including (1) {TTR} or log {INR} variability separately; (2) {TTR} and log {INR} variability together; and (3) both predictors together plus an interaction term. We divided {TTR} into 3 categories (high, {\textgreater}70\%; moderate, 50\% to 70\%; low, {\textless}50\%) and log {INR} variability into 2 categories (stable and unstable). The reference groups high {TTR} and stable anticoagulation each denote good control. Higher log {INR} variability (ie, unstable control) predicted ischemic stroke ({HR}=1.45, P{\textless}0.001) and major bleeding ({HR}=1.57, P{\textless}0.001) independently, regardless of {TTR} levels. Our model with interaction terms showed that High log {INR} variability predicted a significantly higher risk for ischemic stroke and major bleeding compared with low log {INR} variability, at moderate {TTR} levels ({HR}= 1.27 and {HR}=1.29, respectively) and at high {TTR} levels ({HR}=1.55 and {HR}=1.56, respectively), but not at low {TTR} levels.
Conclusions—Unstable anticoagulation predicts warfarin adverse effects independent of {TTR}. Moreover, knowledge about anticoagulation stability further stratifies the risk for adverse events at given levels of {TTR}.  (Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2014;7:664-669.)},

Methods and Results-—{TTR} was calculated using the Rosendaal method, without exclusion of international normalized ratio ({INR}) values performed during warfarin initiation. Measurements during warfarin interruptions {\textgreater}7 days were excluded. {INRs} were performed via standardized ﬁnger-stick point-of-care devices at least every 4 weeks. The primary efﬁcacy endpoint (stroke or noncentral nervous system embolism) was examined by quartiles of {cTTR} and by {cTTR} as a continuous function. Centers with the highest {cTTRs} by quartile had lower-risk patients as reﬂected by lower {CHADS}2 scores (P{\textless}0.0001) and a lower prevalence of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (P{\textless}0.0001). Sites with higher {cTTR} were predominantly from North America and Western Europe. The treatment effect of rivaroxaban versus warfarin on the primary endpoint was consistent across a wide range of {cTTRs} (P value for interaction=0.71). The hazard of major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding increased with {cTTR} (P for interaction=0.001), however, the estimated reduction by rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in the hazard of intracranial hemorrhage was preserved across a wide range of threshold {cTTR} values.
Conclusions-—The treatment effect of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism is consistent regardless of {cTTR}. ( J Am Heart Assoc. 2014;3:e000521 doi: 10.1161/{JAHA}.113.000521)},

Dosing of warfarin should be individualized, since slight overdosing or underdosing can have catastrophic or even fatal consequences. Despite much research on warfarin dosing, current dosing protocols do not live up to expectations, especially for patients sensitive to warfarin. We propose a deep reinforcement learning-based dosing model for warfarin. To overcome the issue of relatively small sample sizes in dosing trials, we use a Pharmacokinetic/ Pharmacodynamic ({PK}/{PD}) model of warfarin to simulate dose-responses of virtual patients.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} - {RATIONALE} {FOR} {STUDY}: Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of stroke and mortality which is reduced by treatment with warfarin. The most commonly used tool to assess the effectiveness of warfarin therapy is the time in therapeutic range ({TTR}) of International Normalised Ratio ({INR}) 2.0-3.0. Our aim was to study whether {INR} variability, as assessed by the standard deviation of transformed {INR} ({SDT}({INR})) is more prognostically important than the {TTR}.
{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We studied 19,180 patients with atrial fibrillation on warfarin therapy to evaluate the association of {TTR} and that of {SDT}({INR}) with all-cause mortality, stroke, bleeding and hospitalisation. The {SDT}({INR}) was more prognostically important than the {TTR}. One standard deviation ({SD}) higher of {SDT}({INR}) had a hazard ratio ({HR}) of 1.59 (95\% {CI} 1.52-1.66) of mortality compared with 1.18 (95\% {CI} 1.13-1.24) for one {SD} lower of {TTR}. For the other 3 events the {HR} was also higher for the {SDT}({INR}) than for the {TTR} (stroke 1.30 (95\% {CI} 1.22-1.39) vs. 1.06 (95\% {CI} 1.00-1.13), bleeding 1.27 (95\% {CI} 1.20-1.35) vs. 1.07 (95\% {CI} 1.01-1.14) , hospitalisation 1.47 (95\% {CI} 1.45-1.49) vs. 1.13 (95\% {CI} 1.10-1.15). When both metrics were included in the same analysis only the {SDT}({INR}) was of significant predictive value.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The {SDT}({INR}) is a better predictor of mortality, stroke, bleeding and hospitalisation than the {TTR} in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving warfarin therapy.},

Objectives The value of assessing {INR} variability by use of the variance growth rate ({VGR}) as a predictor of events was investigated in patients treated with warfarin. Methods Three different methods of {VGR} determination (A, B1, and B2) together with the {TIR} were studied. Method A measures both {INR} variability and control, but methods B1 and B2 measure variability only. The {VGR} and {TIR} were determined over three time periods: overall follow-up to an event, and 6 months and 3 months before an event. Results Six hundred and sixty-one control patients were matched to 158 cases (bleeding, thromboembolism, or death). With all {VGR} methods, the risk of an event was greater in unstable patients at 6 months before an event than in stable patients. Method A demonstrated the greatest risk 3 months before an event in the unstable {VGR} group as compared with the stable group (odds ratio 3.3, 95\% confidence interval 1.9–5.7, P {\textless} 0.005). The risk of an event was 1.9 times greater in patients with a low {TIR} ({\textless} 39\%) than in those with a high {TIR} ({\textgreater} 80\%) in the 3-month period (P = 0.02). Risk of bleeding was significantly greater in the 3-month period in patients with unstable {VGR}, with the greatest risk found with method B2 (P {\textless} 0.01). Conclusions Patients with unstable anticoagulation have a significantly increased risk of ‘clinical events’ at 3 and 6 months before an event. The {VGR} can be incorporated into computer-dosage programs, and may offer additional safety when oral anticoagulation is monitored.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Variability in the intensity of anticoagulant therapy is considered a risk factor for complications, but it is unclear how best to quantify variability.
{OBJECTIVE}: We evaluated the association of three methods to measure variability with complications of oral anticoagulant therapy.
{METHODS}: We conducted a nested case-control study within a cohort of patients with prosthetic heart valves. 210 patients with a first hemorrhagic or thrombotic event during follow-up were selected with two controls per case, matched on age and sex. We calculated the time spent at an International Normalized Ratio below, above, and between 2.5 and 4.0, and the variance growth rate according to three different methods (A, B1, B2); method A combines variability and time in range, and methods B1 and B2 purely look at variability.
{RESULTS}: Odds ratios of the variance growth rates for thrombotic events for patients in the second and third tertiles varied between 2 and 3, with the highest odds ratio for complications for the method that purely looked at variability. For hemorrhagic complications, the highest odds ratios were found for method A, which also incorporated time in range, with odds ratios of 2.6 (95\% {CI}: 1.3-5.1) and 3.1 (95\% {CI}: 1.6-6.0) for the second and third tertiles as compared to the first. The combination of time spent out of range with the highest tertile of variability increased the risk 2.6-fold (95\% {CI}: 1.6-4.2) as compared to subjects with stable anticoagulation within the target range.
{CONCLUSION}: Unstable anticoagulation was associated with hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. Method A was best associated with complications, but methods B1 and B2, in combination with time spent in range, were equally well associated. As we prefer to disentangle variability and intensity of anticoagulation, we propose to use methods B1 or B2 to reflect pure variability of oral anticoagulant therapy.},

	abstract = {Background—

Limited research has compared the measures of summarizing international normalized ratio ({INR}) control over time. Measures that are more predictive of patient outcomes would be preferred as would those that are easier to calculate and understand.

Methods and Results—

We examined 676 patients who received long-term warfarin therapy to treat atrial fibrillation: 125 patients who experienced major hemorrhage and 551 matched controls who did not. Patient {INR} control was characterized using various measures, from simple (proportion of {INR} values in range) to complex (eg, area under the curve above target range, squared) measures. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the ability of each measure to predict the outcome of clinically relevant bleeding across quintiles of control. All measures were associated with clinically relevant bleeding to some extent: patients with the poorest control had significantly more bleeding events compared with patients with the best control. The measure most strongly associated with bleeding was a combination of percent time in therapeutic range and {INR} variability (odds ratio of 4.34, comparing the lowest to the highest quintiles of control). The strongest single predictor was {INR} variability, followed closely by time in therapeutic range. More computationally complex measures, which had been expected to perform better, were not so strongly associated with bleeding.

Conclusions—

{INR} variability was the most strongly associated predictor of clinically relevant bleeding followed closely by time in therapeutic range. Using both measures together had an even stronger association. These findings support continued use of {INR} variability, time in therapeutic range, or both for research and quality assurance efforts.},

	shorttitle = {International Normalized Ratio Variability},
	abstract = {Background
As atrial fibrillation ({AF}) carries twice the mortality hazard when compared with a similar population without diagnosed {AF}, the importance of risk stratifying is obvious. Several variables are related to outcome: age, comorbidities, and use of several medications, particularly oral anticoagulants. The {CHA}2DS2VASc score is an extremely useful tool to predict thromboembolic events and also mortality. The international normalized ratio ({INR}) variability is a treatment efficacy variable also associated with morbidity in patients receiving warfarin. The objective of the study is to compare the prognostic value of the {CHA}2DS2VASc versus the {INR} variability or its combination to predict mortality.
Methods
In this observational study, we analyzed 589 patients from our Atrial Fibrillation Cohort, all on warfarin for more than 1 year and had more than 5 {INRs} performed in the last 2 years. The {CHA}2DS2VASc, {HAS}-{BLED}, and {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 scores were calculated as well as the {INR} variability using the time-in-therapeutic-range ({TTR}), the percentage of {INRs} (\%{INRs}) within range, and the standard deviation of the {INRs} ({SDINRs}). Kaplan–Meier survival curves were plotted via different cutoff points.
Results
The mean {TTR} was 53 ± 23\%; 34.6\% of the patients had a {TTR} above 64\%. The mean \%{INRs} in range was 50.2 ± 20.2; 17.3\% of the population had \%{INRs} in range above 70\%. The mean {SDINRs} was .84 ± .54, and 38.4\% had {SDINRs} below .79. Of 598, 139 (22\%) discontinued warfarin treatment. Death was responsible for almost 50\% of treatment discontinuation. Of 598, 68 patients died during the study period (11.5 \%); the most frequent causes of death were heart failure (30\%), bleeding (17\%), and ischemic stroke (15\%). Patient survival had a correlation with {TTR}, \%{INRs} in range, {SDINRs}, left ventricular ejection fraction, {CHA}2DS2VASc, and the combination of {CHA}2DS2VASc + {SDINRs} (cutoff {\textgreater}1 and {\textgreater}.79, respectively).
Conclusions
{INR} variability is an extremely useful tool to assess anticoagulation quality. Calculation of both {CHA}2DS2VASc and {INR} variability appears to be extremely useful to predict mortality in patients with {AF} receiving warfarin. The {SDINRs} emerges as a strong mortality predictor compared to the other {INR} variability indexes.},

Methods: We used a dataset comprising 131 patients with active cancer and {COVID}-19. We considered ﬁve {ML} models: logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine and Gaussian naive Bayes. We decided to implement the logistic regression model for our study. A model with 19 variables was analyzed. Data were randomly split into training (70\%) and testing (30\%) sets. Model performance was assessed by confusion matrix metrics on the testing data for each model as positive predictive value, sensitivity and F1-score. Results: We showed that the ﬁve selected models outperformed classical statistical methods of predictive validity and logistic regression was the most effective, being able to classify with an accuracy of 81\%. The most relevant result was ﬁnding a patient-proof where python function was able to obtain the exact dose of low weight molecular heparin to be administered and thereby to prevent the occurrence of {VTE}. Conclusions: The world of machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence is constantly developing. The identiﬁcation of a speciﬁc {LMWH} dose for preventing {VTE} in very high-risk populations, such as the {COVID}-19 and active cancer population, might improve with the use of new training {ML}-based algorithms.

	abstract = {Background:  Hemorrhagic events remain a major concern in patients under extracorporeal membrane oxygena‑tion ({ECMO}) support. We tested the association between anticoagulation levels and hemorrhagic events under {ECMO} using anti-Xa activity monitoring.
Methods:  We performed a retrospective multicenter cohort study in three {ECMO} centers. All adult patients treated with veno-venous ({VV})- or veno-arterial ({VA})-{ECMO} in 6 intensive care units between September 2017 and August 2019 were included. Anti-Xa activities were collected until a hemorrhagic event in the bleeding group and for the duration of {ECMO} in the non-bleeding group. All dosages were averaged to obtain means of anti-Xa activity for each patient, and patients were compared according to the occurrence or not of bleeding.
Results:  Among 367 patients assessed for eligibility, 121 were included. Thirty-five (29\%) presented a hemorrhagic complication. In univariate analysis, anti-Xa activities were significantly higher in the bleeding group than in the nonbleeding group, both for the mean anti-Xa activity (0.38 [0.29–0.67] vs 0.33 [0.22–0.42] {IU}/{mL}; p = 0.01) and the maxi‑mal anti-Xa activity (0.83 [0.47–1.46] vs 0.66 [0.36–0.91] {IU}/{mL}; p = 0.05). In the Cox proportional hazard model, mean anti-Xa activity was associated with bleeding (p = 0.0001). By Kaplan–Meier analysis with the cutoff value at 0.46 {IU}/ {mL} obtained by {ROC} curve analysis, the probability of survival under {ECMO} without bleeding was significantly lower when mean anti-Xa was {\textgreater} 0.46 {IU}/{mL} (p = 0.0006).
Conclusion:  In critically ill patients under {ECMO}, mean anti-Xa activity was an independent risk factor for hemor‑rhagic complications. Anticoagulation targets could be revised downward in both {VV}- and {VA}-{ECMO}.},

	abstract = {Background and goal: The Random Forest ({RF}) algorithm for regression and classification has considerably gained popularity since its introduction in 2001. Meanwhile, it has grown to a standard classification approach competing with logistic regression in many innovation-friendly scientific fields.
Results: In this context, we present a large scale benchmarking experiment based on 243 real datasets comparing the prediction performance of the original version of {RF} with default parameters and {LR} as binary classification tools. Most importantly, the design of our benchmark experiment is inspired from clinical trial methodology, thus avoiding common pitfalls and major sources of biases.
Conclusion: {RF} performed better than {LR} according to the considered accuracy measured in approximately 69\% of the datasets. The mean difference between {RF} and {LR} was 0.029 (95\%-{CI}=[ 0.022, 0.038]) for the accuracy, 0.041 (95\%-{CI}=[ 0.031, 0.053]) for the Area Under the Curve, and − 0.027 (95\%-{CI}=[ −0.034, −0.021]) for the Brier score, all measures thus suggesting a significantly better performance of {RF}. As a side-result of our benchmarking experiment, we observed that the results were noticeably dependent on the inclusion criteria used to select the example datasets, thus emphasizing the importance of clear statements regarding this dataset selection process. We also stress that neutral studies similar to ours, based on a high number of datasets and carefully designed, will be necessary in the future to evaluate further variants, implementations or parameters of random forests which may yield improved accuracy compared to the original version with default values.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}) support in acute respiratory failure may be lifesaving, but bleeding and thromboembolic complications are common. The optimal anticoagulation strategy balancing these factors remains to be determined. This retrospective study compared two institutional anticoagulation management strategies focussing on oxygenator changes and both bleeding and thromboembolic events.
{METHODS}: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study between 04/2015 and 02/2020 in two {ECMO} referral centres in Germany in patients receiving veno-venous ({VV})-{ECMO} support for acute respiratory failure for {\textgreater} 24 h. One centre routinely applied low-dose heparinization aiming for a partial thromboplastin time ({PTT}) of 35-40 s and the other routinely used a high-dose therapeutic heparinization strategy aiming for an activated clotting time ({ACT}) of 140-180 s. We assessed number of and time to {ECMO} oxygenator changes, 15-day freedom from oxygenator change, major bleeding events, thromboembolic events, 30-day {ICU} mortality, activated clotting time and partial thromboplastin time and administration of blood products. Primary outcome was the occurrence of oxygenator changes depending on heparinization strategy; main secondary outcomes were the occurrence of severe bleeding events and occurrence of thromboembolic events. The transfusion strategy was more liberal in the low-dose centre.
{RESULTS}: Of 375 screened patients receiving {VV}-{ECMO} support, 218 were included in the analysis (117 high-dose group; 101 low-dose group). Disease severity measured by {SAPS} {II} score was 46 ({IQR} 36-57) versus 47 ({IQR} 37-55) and {ECMO} runtime was 8 ({IQR} 5-12) versus 11 ({IQR} 7-17) days (P = 0.003). There were 14 oxygenator changes in the high-dose group versus 48 in the low-dose group. Freedom from oxygenator change at 15 days was 73\% versus 55\% (adjusted {HR} 3.34 [95\% confidence interval 1.2-9.4]; P = 0.023). Severe bleeding events occurred in 23 (19.7\%) versus 14 (13.9\%) patients (P = 0.256) and thromboembolic events occurred in 8 (6.8\%) versus 19 (19\%) patients (P = 0.007). Mortality at 30 days was 33.3\% versus 30.7\% (P = 0.11).
{CONCLUSIONS}: In this retrospective study, {ECMO} management with high-dose heparinization was associated with lower rates of oxygenator changes and thromboembolic events when compared to a low-dose heparinization strategy. Prospective, randomized trials are needed to determine the optimal anticoagulation strategy in patients receiving {ECMO} support.},

	abstract = {Background: Major bleeding has been a common and serious complication with poor outcomes in {ECMO} patients. With a novel, less-invasive cannulation approach and closer coagulation monitoring regime, the incidence of major bleeding is currently not determined yet. Our study aims to examine the incidence of major bleeding, its determinants, and association with mortality in peripheral-{ECMO} patients.
Method: We conducted a single-center retrospective study on adult patients undergoing peripheral-{ECMO} between January 2019 and January 2020 at a tertiary referral hospital. Determinants of major bleeding were defined by logistic regression analysis. Risk factors of in-hospital mortality were determined by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.
Results: Major bleeding was reported in 33/105 patients (31.4\%) and was associated with higher in-hospital mortality [adjusted hazard ratio ({aHR}) 3.56, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.63-7.80, p {\textless} 0.001). There were no significant difference in age, sex, {ECMO} indications, {ECMO} modality, pre-{ECMO} {APACHE}-{II} and {SOFA} scores between two groups with and without major bleeding. Only {APTT} {\textgreater}72 seconds [adjusted odds ratio ({aOR}) 7.10, 95\% {CI} 2.60-19.50, p {\textless} 0.001], fibrinogen {\textless}2 g/L [{aOR} = 7.10, 95\% {CI} 2.60-19.50, p {\textless} 0.001], and {ACT} {\textgreater}220 seconds [{aOR} = 3.9, 95\% {CI} 1.20-11.80, p=0.017] on days with major bleeding were independent predictors.
Conclusions: In summary, major bleeding still had a fairly high incidence and poor outcome in peripheral-{ECMO} patients. {APTT} {\textgreater} 72 seconds, fibrinogen {\textless} 2 g/L were the strongest predicting factors for major bleeding events.},

Studies varied widely in reporting of study participants, feature characterisation and selection, handling of missing data, sample size calculations and the intended clinical application of the model. Only one study conducted an external validation and no studies evaluated model impacts in clinical practice.
{CONCLUSION}: Studies of {ML} models for {UFH} dosing are few and none report a model ready for routine clinical use. Existing studies are limited by low methodological quality, inadequate reporting of study factors and absence of external validation and impact analysis.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To determine whether there is a difference between an activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}) based unfractionated heparin ({UFH}) protocol versus an antifactor Xa based {UFH} protocol with respect to 24-hour attainment of therapeutic levels.
{METHODS}: This was an observational study performed at a 500 bed private, community hospital. The study included inpatients from January 2008 to December 2009 on our institution's {aPTT} {UFH} protocol and inpatients from July 2010 to March 2011 on our institution's antifactor Xa {UFH} protocol. The two groups were compared to determine whether a higher percentage of patients reached therapeutic goal within 24 hours of {UFH} initiation. Secondary outcomes evaluated the percentage of patients at therapeutic goal within 6 and 12 hours, incidence of bleeding, and number of {UFH} dosage adjustments within 24 hours between the two groups.
{RESULTS}: One hundred twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria for this study; 79 in the {aPTT} group and 42 in the antifactor Xa group. At 24 hours, 74\% of patients in the antifactor Xa group were at goal, versus 63\% of patients in the {aPTT} group (p = 0.242). Nearly 57\% of patients in the antifactor Xa group were at goal versus 27\% in the {aPTT} group within 6 hours (p = 0.001). Subjects in the antifactor Xa group averaged 1.00 dosage adjustments per subject as compared to an 1.71 dosage adjustments per subject in the {aPTT} group within the first 24 hours (p = 0.003).
{CONCLUSION}: The antifactor Xa assay should be used to monitor {UFH} versus {aPTT} due to less variability in measurements, the absence of a need for calibration with new reagents/coagulometers, quicker attainment of therapeutic levels, fewer dose adjustments, and similar bleeding rates.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: This study aimed at analyzing the prevalence, mortality association, and risk factors for bleeding and thrombosis events ({BTEs}) among adults supported with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({VV}-{ECMO}).
{METHODS}: We queried the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry for adults supported with {VV}-{ECMO} from 2010 to 2017. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to assess the association between {BTEs} and in-hospital mortality and the predictors of {BTEs}.
{RESULTS}: Among 7579 {VV}-{ECMO} patients meeting criteria, 40.2\% experienced ≥ 1 {BTE}. Thrombotic events comprised 54.9\% of all {BTEs} and were predominantly {ECMO} circuit thrombosis. {BTE} rates decreased significantly over the study period (p {\textless} 0.001). The inpatient mortality rate was 34.9\%. Bleeding events (1.69 [1.49-1.93]) were more strongly associated with in-hospital mortality than thrombotic events (1.23 [1.08-1.41]) p {\textless} 0.01 for both. The {BTEs} most strongly associated with mortality were ischemic stroke (4.50 [2.55-7.97]) and medical bleeding, including intracranial (5.71 [4.02-8.09]), pulmonary (2.02 [1.54-2.67]), and gastrointestinal (1.54 [1.2-1.98]) hemorrhage, all p {\textless} 0.01. Risk factors for bleeding included acute kidney injury and pre-{ECMO} vasopressor support and for thrombosis were higher weight, multisite cannulation, pre-{ECMO} arrest, and higher {PaCO}2 at {ECMO} initiation. Longer time on {ECMO}, younger age, higher {pH}, and earlier year of support were associated with bleeding and thrombosis.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Although decreasing over time, {BTEs} remain common during {VV}-{ECMO} and have a strong, cumulative association with in-hospital mortality. Thrombotic events are more frequent, but bleeding carries a higher risk of inpatient mortality. Differential risk factors for bleeding and thrombotic complications exist, raising the possibility of a tailored approach to {VV}-{ECMO} management.},

The objective of this study was to compare the correlation between anti-Xa and activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}) with heparin dose and to describe their association with clinical events in adult {ECMO} patients. We conducted a retrospective single-center study of 34 adult {ECMO} patients whose heparin was monitored by anti-Xa and/or {aPTT}. The heparin dose-to-assay correlation coefficient was 0.106 for {aPTT} and 0.414 for anti-Xa (p {\textless} 0.001). Major thrombotic and hemorrhagic events occurred in 14.7\% and 26.5\% of patients, respectively. The median anti-Xa in patients who experienced a major thrombotic event was 0.09 (0.06–0.25) {IU}/{mL} compared with 0.36 (0.26–0.44) {IU}/{mL} in patients who did not (p = 0.031), whereas the median {aPTT} did not differ between these groups. The maximum {aPTT} in patients who experienced a major bleed was 96.9 (76.0–200) seconds compared with 63.5 (44.4–98.6) seconds in patients who did not (p = 0.049), whereas the maximum anti-Xa did not differ between these groups. Monitoring both anti-Xa and {aPTT} may be warranted to safely provide understanding of pure heparin activity as well as underlying bleeding diatheses in adult {ECMO} patients.},

	doi = {10.1513/AnnalsATS.201605-364SR},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The optimal anticoagulation strategy for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({VV}-{ECMO}) is not known.
{OBJECTIVES}: To evaluate the safety of anticoagulation strategies and monitoring during {VV}-{ECMO} for respiratory failure.
{DATA} {SOURCES}: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the association between anticoagulation strategies during {VV}-{ECMO} and prespecified outcomes, including major bleeding episodes, thrombotic events, and in-hospital mortality. We included articles published between 1977 and January 30, 2015. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scoring system. A separate meta-analysis was not planned.
{DATA} {EXTRACTION}: Data were independently extracted by two authors and collected on a standardized report form.
{SYNTHESIS}: A total of 18 studies (n = 646) were included; 17 studies enrolled patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Across all studies, the duration of {VV}-{ECMO} support ranged from 4 to 20 days. Patients received an average of 2.3 (±3.9) units of transfused red blood cells per day. The bleeding rate across all studies was 16\%, and the rate of thrombosis was 53\%. Among seven studies (199 patients) targeting a specified activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}), there were 37 (19\%) major bleeding episodes and 53 (27\%) major thromboses. Among five studies (43 patients) with {aPTT} targets of 60 seconds or greater, there were 24 (56\%) bleeding episodes and 3 (7\%) clotting events. Three studies (156 patients) with an {aPTT} target under 60 seconds reported 13 (8\%) and 50 (32\%) significant bleeding and thrombotic events, respectively. The most commonly reported thrombotic events were circuit-related clotting and deep-vein thrombosis. Mortality during {VV}-{ECMO} varied across the studies, ranging from 0 to at least 50\% at heterogeneous time points. The total number of deaths for all studies combined was 186 (29\%).
{CONCLUSIONS}: The role and optimal therapeutic targets for anticoagulation during {VV}-{ECMO} are unclear. Previously published studies are limited by retrospective, observational design, small cohorts, and patient heterogeneity. The clinical significance of reported thrombotic complications is largely unknown. This systematic review underscores the need for randomized controlled trials of anticoagulation strategies for patients undergoing {VV}-{ECMO} for respiratory failure.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Selection bias in case–control studies occurs when control selection is inappropriate. However, selection bias due to improper case sampling is less well recognized. We describe how to recognize survivor bias (i.e., selection on exposed cases) and illustrate this with an example study.
Study Design and Setting
A case–control study was used to analyze the effect of statins on major bleedings during treatment with vitamin K antagonists. A total of 110 patients who experienced such bleedings were included 18–1,018 days after the bleeding complication and matched to 220 controls.
Results
A protective association of major bleeding for exposure to statins (odds ratio [{OR}]: 0.56; 95\% confidence interval: 0.29–1.08) was found, which did not become stronger after adjustment for confounding factors. These observations lead us to suspect survivor bias. To identify this bias, results were stratified on time between bleeding event and inclusion, and repeated for a negative control (an exposure not related to survival): blood group non-O. The {ORs} for exposure to statins increased gradually to 1.37 with shorter time between outcome and inclusion, whereas {ORs} for the negative control remained constant, confirming our hypothesis.
Conclusion
We recommend the presented method to check for overoptimistic results, that is, survivor bias in case–control studies.},

The sparsity, noise, and high dimensionality of these data present unique challenges.

In this review, we provide a guide to {PCA} and related methods. We describe the relationship between {PCA} and singular value decomposition, the difference between {PCA} of a correlation and covariance matrix, the impact of scaling, log-transforming, and standardization, and how to recognize a horseshoe or arch effect in a {PCA}. We describe canonical correlation analysis ({CCA}), a popular matrix factorization approach for the integration of single-cell data from different platforms or studies. We discuss alternatives to {CCA} and why additional preprocessing or weighting datasets within the joint decomposition should be considered.},

Overall, major bleeding events were significantly lower in the L-{PTT} group than in the {ACT} and H-{PTT} groups. There was no difference in thrombotic events. In this single-institution experience, a L-{PTT}, high-flow strategy on {VV}-{ECMO} was associated with fewer bleeding and no difference in thrombotic events than an {ACT} or H-{PTT} strategy....},

	abstract = {Background—

Anticoagulation control with warfarin, as assessed by the international normalized ratio ({INR}), is challenging. Time in the therapeutic range has been inversely correlated with major hemorrhage, thrombosis, and mortality. Quest Diagnostics offers standardized {INR} laboratory testing services to approximately half of {US} physician practices. To inform national stroke prevention strategies, we evaluated anticoagulation control in office-based community practices.

Methods and Results—

We selected individuals with ≥2 months of {INR} data, {INR} results of {\textgreater}1.2, and an {ICD}-9 diagnosis code of atrial fibrillation. Frequency of {INR} testing and time in the therapeutic range were analyzed by age, sex, length of testing period, number of referred patients per provider, and median household income (based on home {ZIP} code). We identified 138 319 individuals referred by 37 939 physicians, yielding a total of 2 683 674 {INR} results. Patients had a mean age of 74 years; 81\% were ≥65 years of age, and 55\% were ≥75 years of age. The mean time in the therapeutic range was 53.7\% overall and improved with time on treatment, increasing from 47.6\% for patients with {\textless}6 months of testing to 57.5\% for those with ≥6 months of testing (P{\textless}0.0001). The number of patients tested per physician practice was positively associated with time in the therapeutic range. Younger age, female sex, and lower income were also independently associated with poorer anticoagulant control.

Conclusion—

This study demonstrates widespread suboptimal anticoagulation control, suggesting an urgent need to improve oral anticoagulation care for most patient segments in the United States.},

	abstract = {Variability in the control of oral anticoagulant therapy has been associated with a heightened risk of complications. We compared control of anticoagulation between two commonly used coumarins, phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol, and among anticoagulation clinics. All qualifying patients were managed at six regional anticoagulation clinics in the Netherlands. This retrospective cohort study compiled data during a three-year period from a computerised dosing and management system. Anticoagulation control was expressed as the percent of time within the therapeutic range and stability expressed as the time-weighted variance in the international normalised ratio ({INR}). Data were available for 22,178 patients of whom 72\% were treated with acenocoumarol. {INRs} of patients who received phenprocoumon were within the therapeutic range 50\% of the time compared with 43\% for acenocoumarol ({OR} 1.32, 95\% {CI} 1.24-1.41). Moreover, patients on phenprocoumon required 15\% fewer monitoring visits and had more stable {INR} values. These observations were consistent for all six clinics. There were also sizable differences between the clinics with respect to control and stability of anticoagulation that were stable from year-to-year and were unrelated to the drug used. With its longer half-life of three to five days, phenprocoumon produces more stable anticoagulation than acenocoumarol and should generally be the drug of choice when these are the available choices. The differences observed among clinics suggest that certain clinics employ policies and practices resulting in better control of anticoagulation.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The results of clinical trials often hinge on the quality of oral anticoagulation management, yet the quality of such management is frequently not mentioned or measured. Time-in-therapeutic range ({TTR}) is one measure of quality of anticoagulation dose management, but various methodologies exist for measuring {TTR}.
{OBJECTIVE}: This study was initiated to compare three commonly used methodologies for measuring {TTR} to see how they compare within the same cohort of patients.
{PATIENTS}/{METHODS}: Three common methodologies of calculating time-in-therapeutic range were analyzed retrospectively in a cohort of patients over six two-month intervals. Additional analysis was performed for three and six-month intervals. The methodologies included fraction of {INRs} in range; cross-section of the files; and linear interpolation.
{RESULTS}: Fraction of the {INRs} in range and cross-section of the files methodologies gave similar results, while linear interpolation yielded significantly shorter time-in-range for the two-month, three-month, and six-month intervals measured. The advantages and disadvantages of each methodology are discussed.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The decision of which method to use should be based on clinic size, information desired, and clinic resources for ease of applying either of the methods in clinical practice. Each of these methodologies has their limitations and the question remains as to which method best reflects the quality of anticoagulation management. Regardless of these limitations, investigators are urged to employ at least one method of measuring the quality of oral anticoagulation management so as to better assess the validity of the clinical outcomes.},

It is based on the assumption that the dependent variable is beta-distributed and that its mean is related to a set of regressors through a linear predictor with unknown coeﬃcients and a link function. The model also includes a precision parameter which may be constant or depend on a (potentially diﬀerent) set of regressors through a link function as well. This approach naturally incorporates features such as heteroskedasticity or skewness which are commonly observed in data taking values in the standard unit interval, such as rates or proportions. This paper describes the betareg package which provides the class of beta regressions in the R system for statistical computing.

The authors present maximum-likelihood regression models assuming that the dependent variable is conditionally beta distributed rather than Gaussian. The approach models both means (location) and variances (dispersion) with their own distinct sets of predictors (continuous and/or categorical), thereby modeling heteroscedasticity. The location sub-model link function is the logit and thereby analogous to logistic regression, whereas the dispersion sub-model is log linear. Real examples show that these models handle the independent observations case readily.

	abstract = {Health-related quality of life has become an increasingly important indicator of health status in clinical trials and epidemiological research. Moreover, the study of the relationship of health-related quality of life with patients and disease characteristics has become one of the primary aims of many health-related quality of life studies. Health-related quality of life scores are usually assumed to be distributed as binomial random variables and often highly skewed. The use of the beta-binomial distribution in the regression context has been proposed to model such data; however, the beta-binomial regression has been performed by means of two different approaches in the literature: (i) beta-binomial distribution with a logistic link; and (ii) hierarchical generalized linear models. None of the existing literature in the analysis of health-related quality of life survey data has performed a comparison of both approaches in terms of adequacy and regression parameter interpretation context. This paper is motivated by the analysis of a real data application of health-related quality of life outcomes in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, where the use of both approaches yields to contradictory results in terms of covariate effects significance and consequently the interpretation of the most relevant factors in health-related quality of life. We present an explanation of the results in both methodologies through a simulation study and address the need to apply the proper approach in the analysis of health-related quality of life survey data for practitioners, providing an R package.},

Major society guidelines recommend continuous, systemic anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of the {ECMO} circuit, though this may be undesirable in those with active, or high risk of, bleeding. We aimed to systematically review thrombosis and bleeding outcomes in published cases of adults treated with {ECMO} without continuous systemic anticoagulation. Ovid {MEDLINE}, Cochrane {CENTRAL} and {CDSR}, and hand search via {SCOPUS} were queried. Eligible studies were independently reviewed by two blinded authors if they reported adults (≥18 years) treated with either {VV}- or {VA}-{ECMO} without continuous systemic anticoagulation for ≥24 hours. Patient demographics, clinical data, and specifics of {ECMO} technology and treatment parameters were collected. Primary outcomes of interest included incidence of bleeding, thrombosis of the {ECMO} circuit requiring equipment exchange, patient venous or arterial thrombosis, ability to wean off of {ECMO}, and mortality. Of the 443 total publications identified, 34 describing 201 patients met our inclusion criteria. Most patients were treated for either acute respiratory distress syndrome or cardiogenic shock. The median duration of anticoagulant-free {ECMO} was 4.75 days. {ECMO} circuity thrombosis and patient thrombosis occurred in 27 (13.4\%) and 19 (9.5\%) patients, respectively. Any bleeding and major or “severe” bleeding was reported in 66 (32.8\%) and 56 (27.9\%) patients, respectively. 40 patients (19\%) died. While limited by primarily retrospective data and inconsistent reporting of outcomes, our systematic review of anticoagulant-free {ECMO} reveals an incidence of circuity and patient thrombosis comparable to patients receiving continuous systemic anticoagulation while on {ECMO}.},

	abstract = {Objective To estimate the effect of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}) compared with conventional mechanical ventilation on outcomes of patients with covid-19 associated respiratory failure.
Design Observational study.
Setting 30 countries across five continents, 3 January 2020 to 29 August 2021.
Participants 7345 adults admitted to the intensive care unit with clinically suspected or laboratory confirmed {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection.
Interventions {ECMO} in patients with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ({PaO}2/{FiO}2) ratio {\textless}80 mm Hg compared with conventional mechanical ventilation without {ECMO}.
Main outcome measure The primary outcome was hospital mortality within 60 days of admission to the intensive care unit. Adherence adjusted estimates were calculated using marginal structural models with inverse probability weighting, accounting for competing events and for baseline and time varying confounding.
Results 844 of 7345 eligible patients (11.5\%) received {ECMO} at any time point during follow-up. Adherence adjusted mortality was 26.0\% (95\% confidence interval 24.5\% to 27.5\%) for a treatment strategy that included {ECMO} if the {PaO}2/{FiO}2 ratio decreased {\textless}80 mm Hg compared with 33.2\% (31.8\% to 34.6\%) had patients received conventional treatment without {ECMO} (risk difference –7.1\%, 95\% confidence interval –8.2\% to –6.1\%; risk ratio 0.78, 95\% confidence interval 0.75 to 0.82). In secondary analyses, {ECMO} was most effective in patients aged {\textless}65 years and with a {PaO}2/{FiO}2 {\textless}80 mm Hg or with driving pressures {\textgreater}15 {cmH}2O during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation.
Conclusions {ECMO} was associated with a reduction in mortality in selected adults with covid-19 associated respiratory failure. Age, severity of hypoxaemia, and duration and intensity of mechanical ventilation were found to be modifiers of treatment effectiveness and should be considered when deciding to initiate {ECMO} in patients with covid-19.},

	abstract = {Despite ongoing control efforts, rabies remains an endemic zoonotic disease in many countries. Determining high-risk areas and the space-time patterns of rabies spread, as it relates to epidemiologically important factors, can support policymakers and program managers alike to develop evidence-based targeted surveillance and control programs. In this One Health approach which selected Thailand as the example site, the location-based risk of contracting dog-mediated rabies by both human and animal populations was quantified using a Bayesian spatial regression model. Specifically, a conditional autoregressive ({CAR}) Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson ({ZIP}) regression was fitted to the reported human and animal rabies case counts of each district, from the 2012-2017 period. The human population was used as an offset. The epidemiologically important factors hypothesized as risk modifiers and therefore tested as predictors included: number of dog bites/attacks, the population of dogs and cats, number of Buddhist temples, garbage dumps, animal vaccination, post-exposure prophylaxis, poverty, and shared administrative borders. Disparate sources of data were used to improve the estimated associations and predictions. Model performance was assessed using cross-validation. Results suggested that accounting for the association between human and animal rabies with number of dog bites/attacks, number of owned and un-owned dogs; shared country borders, number of Buddhist temples, poverty levels, and accounting for spatial dependence between districts, may help to predict the risk districts for dog-mediated rabies in Thailand. The fitted values of the spatial regression were mapped to illustrate the risk of dog-mediated rabies. The cross-validation indicated an adequate performance of the spatial regression model ({AUC} = 0.81), suggesting that had this spatial regression approach been used to identify districts at risk in 2015, the cases reported in 2016/17 would have been predicted with model sensitivity and specificity of 0.71 and 0.80, respectively. While active surveillance is ideal, this approach of using multiple data sources to improve risk estimation may inform current rabies surveillance and control efforts including determining rabies-free zones, and the roll-out of human post-exposure prophylaxis and anti-rabies vaccines for animals in determining high-risk areas.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: During the initial phase of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) pandemic, reduced numbers of acutely ill or injured children presented to emergency departments ({EDs}). Concerns were raised about the potential for delayed and more severe presentations and an increase in diagnoses such as diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health issues. This multinational observational study aimed to study the number of children presenting to {EDs} across Europe during the early {COVID}-19 pandemic and factors influencing this and to investigate changes in severity of illness and diagnoses.
{METHODS} {AND} {FINDINGS}: Routine health data were extracted retrospectively from electronic patient records of children aged 18 years and under, presenting to 38 {EDs} in 16 European countries for the period January 2018 to May 2020, using predefined and standardized data domains. Observed and predicted numbers of {ED} attendances were calculated for the period February 2020 to May 2020. Poisson models and incidence rate ratios ({IRRs}), using predicted counts for each site as offset to adjust for case-mix differences, were used to compare age groups, diagnoses, and outcomes. Reductions in pediatric {ED} attendances, hospital admissions, and high triage urgencies were seen in all participating sites. {ED} attendances were relatively higher in countries with lower {SARS}-{CoV}-2 prevalence ({IRR} 2.26, 95\% {CI} 1.90 to 2.70, p {\textless} 0.001) and in children aged {\textless}12 months (12 to {\textless}24 months {IRR} 0.86, 95\% {CI} 0.84 to 0.89; 2 to {\textless}5 years {IRR} 0.80, 95\% {CI} 0.78 to 0.82; 5 to {\textless}12 years {IRR} 0.68, 95\% {CI} 0.67 to 0.70; 12 to 18 years {IRR} 0.72, 95\% {CI} 0.70 to 0.74; versus age {\textless}12 months as reference group, p {\textless} 0.001). The lowering of pediatric intensive care admissions was not as great as that of general admissions ({IRR} 1.30, 95\% {CI} 1.16 to 1.45, p {\textless} 0.001). Lower triage urgencies were reduced more than higher triage urgencies (urgent triage {IRR} 1.10, 95\% {CI} 1.08 to 1.12; emergent and very urgent triage {IRR} 1.53, 95\% {CI} 1.49 to 1.57; versus nonurgent triage category, p {\textless} 0.001). Reductions were highest and sustained throughout the study period for children with communicable infectious diseases. The main limitation was the retrospective nature of the study, using routine clinical data from a wide range of European hospitals and health systems.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Reductions in {ED} attendances were seen across Europe during the first {COVID}-19 lockdown period. More severely ill children continued to attend hospital more frequently compared to those with minor injuries and illnesses, although absolute numbers fell.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}) in adults with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome has increased in the past 10 years. However, the efficacy of venovenous {ECMO} in people with acute respiratory distress syndrome is uncertain according to the most recent data. We aimed to estimate the effect of venovenous {ECMO} on mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome.
{METHODS}: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched {MEDLINE} (including {MEDLINE} In-Process and Epub Ahead of Print), Embase and the Wiley search platform in the Cochrane database for randomised controlled trials and observational studies with matching of conventional mechanical ventilation with and without venovenous {ECMO} in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles were screened in duplicate by two investigators. Data for study design, patient characteristics, interventions, and study outcomes were abstracted independently and in duplicate. Studies were weighted with the inverse variance method and data were pooled via random-effects modelling. We calculated risk ratios ({RRs}) and 95\% {CIs} to summarise results. The primary outcome was 60-day mortality across randomised controlled trials. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation ({GRADE}) guidelines were used to rate the quality of evidence {FINDINGS}: We included five studies, two randomised controlled trials and three observational studies with matching techniques (total N=773 patients). In the primary analysis, which included two randomised controlled trials with a total population of 429 patients, 60-day mortality was significantly lower in the venovenous {ECMO} group than in the control group (73 [34\%] of 214 vs 101 [47\%] of 215; {RR} 0·73 [95\% {CI} 0·58-0·92]; p=0·008; I2 0\%). The {GRADE} level of evidence for this outcome was moderate. Three studies included data for the incidence of major haemorrhage in the {ECMO} group. 48 (19\%) of the 251 patients in these three studies had major haemorrhages.
{INTERPRETATION}: Compared with conventional mechanical ventilation, use of venovenous {ECMO} in adults with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with reduced 60-day mortality. However, venovenous {ECMO} was also associated with a moderate risk of major bleeding. These findings have important implications surrounding decision making for management of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome at centres providing venovenous {ECMO}.

Pre-{ECMO} use of prone positioning and neuromuscular blockers were 26\% and 62\%, respectively. Vt (6.4 ± 2.0 vs. 3.7 ± 2.0 ml/kg), plateau pressure (32 ± 7 vs. 24 ± 7 cm H2O), driving pressure (20 ± 7 vs. 14 ± 4 cm H2O), respiratory rate (26 ± 8 vs. 14 ± 6 breaths/min), and mechanical power (26.1 ± 12.7 vs. 6.6 ± 4.8 J/min) were markedly reduced after {ECMO} initiation. Six-month survival was 61\%. No association was found between ventilator settings during the first 2 days of {ECMO} and survival in multivariable analysis. A time-varying Cox model retained older age, higher fluid balance, higher lactate, and more need for renal-replacement therapy along the {ECMO} course as being independently associated with 6-month mortality. A higher Vt and lower driving pressure (likely markers of static compliance improvement) across the {ECMO} course were also associated with better outcomes.Conclusions: Ultraprotective lung ventilation on {ECMO} was largely adopted across medium- to high-case volume {ECMO} centers.

A review of the experimental basis for heparin monitoring by the {PTT} reveals significant shortcomings of the assay. The availability of anti-Xa heparin assays on automated coagulation analyzers presents a seemingly logical alternative because the {PTT} therapeutic range is derived from anti-Xa measurements of plasma from heparinized patients. The anti-Xa assay is not susceptible to many of the preanalytical interferences affecting the {PTT}, and adoption of anti-Xa monitoring would eliminate the need for validating a {PTT} therapeutic range. However, anti-Xa heparin monitoring has not been rigorously validated by clinical outcomes studies, and decreasing clinical use of unfractionated heparin makes it unlikely that such data is forthcoming. Nonetheless, many laboratories may find themselves in the position of being unable to continue to validate their {PTT} therapeutic ranges according to current recommendations and accreditation requirements.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To determine whether there is a difference between an activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}) based unfractionated heparin ({UFH}) protocol versus an antifactor Xa based {UFH} protocol with respect to 24-hour attainment of therapeutic levels.
{METHODS}: This was an observational study performed at a 500 bed private, community hospital. The study included inpatients from January 2008 to December 2009 on our institution's {aPTT} {UFH} protocol and inpatients from July 2010 to March 2011 on our institution's antifactor Xa {UFH} protocol. The two groups were compared to determine whether a higher percentage of patients reached therapeutic goal within 24 hours of {UFH} initiation. Secondary outcomes evaluated the percentage of patients at therapeutic goal within 6 and 12 hours, incidence of bleeding, and number of {UFH} dosage adjustments within 24 hours between the two groups.
{RESULTS}: One hundred twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria for this study; 79 in the {aPTT} group and 42 in the antifactor Xa group. At 24 hours, 74\% of patients in the antifactor Xa group were at goal, versus 63\% of patients in the {aPTT} group (p = 0.242). Nearly 57\% of patients in the antifactor Xa group were at goal versus 27\% in the {aPTT} group within 6 hours (p = 0.001). Subjects in the antifactor Xa group averaged 1.00 dosage adjustments per subject as compared to an 1.71 dosage adjustments per subject in the {aPTT} group within the first 24 hours (p = 0.003).
{CONCLUSION}: The antifactor Xa assay should be used to monitor {UFH} versus {aPTT} due to less variability in measurements, the absence of a need for calibration with new reagents/coagulometers, quicker attainment of therapeutic levels, fewer dose adjustments, and similar bleeding rates.},

	abstract = {{WHAT} {IS} {KNOWN} {AND} {OBJECTIVES}: The two most common methods for monitoring unfractionated heparin ({UFH}) infusion are the activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}) and the antifactor Xa heparin assay (anti-Xa). The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of an {aPTT} protocol vs. an anti-Xa protocol in adult patients as defined by the time to reach therapeutic range, the percentage of time the values were within the goal range and the number of times laboratory monitoring was conducted. We then analysed the discordance between paired values of anti-Xa and {aPTT}.
{METHODS}: This was a single-centre prospective cohort pilot study conducted from 1 September 2013 to 31 May 2014.
{RESULTS}: Eighty-five patients were treated with {UFH} infusion, {aPTT} monitoring (n = 48), anti-Xa monitoring (n = 37). The number of times {aPTT} and anti-Xa values were ordered was (median, {IQR}) 14 (2-34) vs 7 (2-76); P = 0·23. The time to reach therapeutic range in hours was (mean, {SD}) 22 (20) {aPTT} vs 15 (13) anti-Xa; P = 0·08. Therapeutic range ({\textgreater}50-100\% of the time) was achieved in only 5 (10\%) patients in the {aPTT} group vs. 21 (57\%) in the anti-Xa group; P {\textless} 0·01. Supratherapeutic values ({\textgreater}50-100\%) were observed in 38 (78\%) patients in the {aPTT} group vs. 14 (38\%) in the anti-Xa group; P {\textless} 0·01. The discordance between {aPTT} and anti-Xa was evaluated using 234 paired values from 37 patients. There was discordance between anti-Xa and {aPTT} values 57\% of the time. Two patients had bleeding complications requiring blood transfusion or discontinuation of post-pilot protocol.
{WHAT} {IS} {NEW} {AND} {CONCLUSION}: Utilizing an anti-Xa protocol to monitor heparin infusion showed favourable results compared with utilizing an {aPTT} protocol by maintaining values within the therapeutic goal range. The most common discordant pattern in our study was a disproportionate prolongation of {aPTT} to anti-Xa values. Patients with discordant values presenting with high {aPTT} to normal anti-Xa values may have an increased risk of bleeding complications.},

The great majority of {COVID}-19 patients ({\textgreater}90\%) requiring {ECMO} have been supported using venovenous (V-V) {ECMO} for acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}). While {COVID}-19 {ECMO} run duration may be longer than in non-{COVID}-19 {ECMO} patients, published mortality appears to be similar between the two groups. However, data collection is ongoing, and there is a signal that overall mortality may be increasing. Conventional selection criteria for {COVID}-19-related {ECMO} should be used; however, when resources become more constrained during a pandemic, more stringent contraindications should be implemented. Formation of regional {ECMO} referral networks may facilitate communication, resource sharing, expedited patient referral, and mobile {ECMO} retrieval. There are no data to suggest deviation from conventional {ECMO} device or patient management when applying {ECMO} for {COVID}-19 patients. Rarely, children may require {ECMO} support for {COVID}-19-related {ARDS}, myocarditis, or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children ({MIS}-C); conventional selection criteria and management practices should be the standard. We strongly encourage participation in data submission to investigate the optimal use of {ECMO} for {COVID}-19.},

	volume = {45},
	issn = {1542-6270},
	doi = {10.1345/aph.1Q161},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Unfractionated heparin ({UFH}) has been used clinically for 5 decades. Despite being a cornerstone of anticoagulation, {UFH} is limited by its unpredictable pharmacokinetic profile, which makes close laboratory monitoring necessary. The most common methods for monitoring {UFH} are the activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}) and antifactor Xa heparin assay (anti-Xa {HA}), but both present challenges, and the optimal method to monitor {UFH} remains unclear.
{OBJECTIVE}: To compare the performance of the {aPTT} with the anti-Xa {HA} for efficiency and safety of monitoring intravenous {UFH} infusions.
{METHODS}: This was a single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study conducted in an 852-bed academic medical center.
{RESULTS}: One hundred patients receiving intravenous {UFH} for a variety of indications were enrolled in the study; 50 were assigned to each group. The mean ({SD}) time to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation was significantly less in the anti-Xa {HA} group compared with the {aPTT} group (28 [16] vs 48 [26] hours, p {\textless} 0.001). In addition, a greater percentage of anti-Xa {HA} patients compared to {aPTT} patients achieved therapeutic anticoagulation at 24 hours ({OR} 3.5; 95\% {CI} 1.5 to 8.7) and 48 hours ({OR} 10.9; 95\% {CI} 3.3 to 44.2). Patients in the anti-Xa {HA} group also had more test values within the therapeutic range (66\% vs 42\%, p {\textless} 0.0001). A significant difference was seen between the 2 groups in the number of {aPTT} or anti-Xa {HA} tests performed per 24 hours (p {\textless} 0.0001) and number of infusion rate changes per 24 hours (p {\textless} 0.01), both favoring the anti-Xa {HA} group.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Monitoring intravenous {UFH} infusions with the anti-Xa {HA}, compared to the {aPTT}, achieves therapeutic anticoagulation more rapidly, maintains the values within the goal range for a longer time, and requires fewer adjustments in dosage and repeated tests.},

	title = {A randomized trial comparing activated thromboplastin time with heparin assay in patients with acute venous thromboembolism requiring large daily doses of heparin},
	volume = {154},
	issn = {0003-9926},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The management of heparin therapy in patients who have a subtherapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time ({APTT}) despite high doses of heparin is problematic because the risk of heparin-associated bleeding increases with dose. Results of experimental studies in animals indicate that when the {APTT} response to heparin is blunted by infusion of procoagulants, dose escalation can be avoided without compromising efficacy, by monitoring treatment with a heparin assay.
{METHODS}: A randomized, controlled trial was conducted in which patients with acute deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or axillary vein thrombosis who required 35,000 U or more of intravenous heparin by continuous infusion during the previous 24 hours were allocated to have their heparin therapy monitored either by anti-factor Xa levels (targeted range, 0.35 to 0.67 U/{mL}) or by the {APTT} (targeted range, 60 to 85 seconds). Both ranges were equivalent to a heparin level of 0.2 to 0.4 U/{mL} by protamine titration.
{RESULTS}: Three (4.6\%) of 65 patients in the anti-factor Xa group experienced recurrent venous thromboembolism compared with four (6.1\%) of 66 patients in the {APTT} group (difference, 1.5\%; confidence interval, -6.7\% to 8.4\%) (P = .7). There were four bleeding events (6.1\%) in the {APTT} group compared with one (1.5\%) in the anti-factor Xa group (difference, 4.6\%; confidence interval, -3.3\% to 7.5\%) (P = .4). During the period of heparin therapy before warfarin treatment was begun, the patients in the {APTT} group required a statistically significantly greater amount of heparin compared with the patients in the anti-factor Xa group. The daily mean {APTT} was subtherapeutic in patients in the anti-factor Xa group, and it was within the therapeutic range in the {APTT} group. The daily mean anti-factor Xa levels for both groups were within the therapeutic range.
{CONCLUSION}: The heparin assay is a safe and effective method for monitoring heparin treatment in patients with acute venous thromboembolism whose {APTT} remains subtherapeutic despite large daily doses of heparin. In such patients, dosage escalation can be avoided if the heparin level is therapeutic.},

The objective of this study was to compare the correlation between anti-Xa and activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}) with heparin dose and to describe their association with clinical events in adult {ECMO} patients. We conducted a retrospective single-center study of 34 adult {ECMO} patients whose heparin was monitored by anti-Xa and/or {aPTT}. The heparin dose-to-assay correlation coefficient was 0.106 for {aPTT} and 0.414 for anti-Xa (p {\textless} 0.001). Major thrombotic and hemorrhagic events occurred in 14.7\% and 26.5\% of patients, respectively. The median anti-Xa in patients who experienced a major thrombotic event was 0.09 (0.06-0.25) {IU}/{mL} compared with 0.36 (0.26-0.44) {IU}/{mL} in patients who did not (p = 0.031), whereas the median {aPTT} did not differ between these groups.

Monitoring both anti-Xa and {aPTT} may be warranted to safely provide understanding of pure heparin activity as well as underlying bleeding diatheses in adult {ECMO} patients.},

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using multiple electronic databases and included studies from inception to July 19, 2019. The proportion of bleeding, thrombosis, and mortality were evaluated.Twenty-six studies (2,086 patients) were included. Bleeding occurred in 34.2\% (95\%{CI} 25.1;43.9) of the patients with anti-Xa-based versus 41.6\% (95\%{CI} 24.9;59.4) of the patients with time-based anticoagulation strategies. Thrombosis occurred in 32.6\% (95\%{CI} 19.1;47.7) of the patients with anti-Xa-based versus 38.4\% (95\%{CI} 22.2;56.1) of the patients with time-based anticoagulation strategies. And mortality rate was 35.4\% (95\%{CI} 28.9;42.1) of the patients with anti-Xa-based versus 42.9\% (95\%{CI} 36.9;48.9) of the patients with time-based anticoagulation strategies.

{DESIGN}: Retrospective chart review.
{SETTING}: {PICU} in a single, tertiary care, academic children's hospital.
{PATIENTS}: Seventeen patients (age 1 d to 13.9 yr, median 0.83 yr) managed on pulmonary and cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between March 2010 and August 2012 by a single surgeon.
{INTERVENTIONS}: None.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Twice daily measurements of anti-Factor Xa assay, activated clotting time, and activated partial thromboplastin time were determined from the same blood specimen. Data were analyzed using {SAS} system v9.2. Fourteen patients (82.4\%) were successfully weaned from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and 12 (70.6\%) were discharged from the hospital. Pearson correlations were used to compare heparin dose and activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and anti-Factor Xa assay. Analysis showed negative Pearson correlations in 11 of 17 patients between the activated clotting time and heparin, as compared with seven of 17 for activated partial thromboplastin time and only one for heparin and anti-Factor Xa assay. Only four patients had moderate to strong positive correlations between activated clotting time and heparin as compared with a moderate to strong positive correlation in 10 patients for anti-Factor Xa assay and heparin.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The anti-Factor Xa assay correlated better with heparin dosing than activated clotting time or activated partial thromboplastin time. Activated clotting time has a poor correlation to heparin doses commonly associated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, anti-Factor Xa assay may be a more valuable monitor of heparin administration.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To determine if a comprehensive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation anticoagulation monitoring protocol results in fewer hemorrhagic complications, reduced blood product usage, and increased circuit life.
{DESIGN}: In September 2011, we augmented our standard extracorporeal membrane oxygenation laboratory protocol to include anti-factor Xa assays, thromboelastography, and antithrombin measurements. We performed a retrospective chart review to determine outcomes for patients placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation prior to and after the initiation of our anticoagulation laboratory protocol.
{SETTING}: Tertiary care, academic children's hospital.
{PATIENTS}: All patients who were placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at our institution from January 1, 2007, to September 30, 2013.
{INTERVENTIONS}: None.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: There were 261 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation runs before the initiation of the protocol and 105 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation runs after the initiation of the protocol. There were no major changes to our extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit or changes to our transfusion threshold during the study period. The indication for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, age, and severity of illness of the patients were similar before and after protocol initiation. Median blood product usage for packed {RBCs}, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate decreased significantly after protocol initiation. The occurrence of cannula site bleeding decreased from 22\% to 12\% (p = 0.04), and surgical site bleeding decreased from 38\% to 25\% (p = 0.02). Median extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit life increased from 3.6 to 4.3 days (p = 0.02). A trend toward increased patient survival was noted, but it did not reach statistical significance.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We demonstrate an association between an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation anticoagulation laboratory protocol using anti-factor Xa assays, thromboelastography, and antithrombin measurements and a decrease in blood product transfusion, a decrease in hemorrhagic complications, and an increase in circuit life. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate clinical benefit associated with the use of these laboratory values for patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.},

This retrospective cohort study explored safety and efficacy outcome differences between anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) and activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}) for {UFH} in adult venoarterial {ECMO}. Forty-one patients were included and analyzed. The {UFH} rate at first goal and time to goal were both higher in the {aPTT} versus anti-Xa cohort but did not achieve statistical significance (12.14 vs. 9.58 unit/kg/hour (p = 0.29), 20.22 vs. 12.05 hours (p = 0.11)). The {aPTT} cohort was in target goals 35.0\% of the time versus 47.7\% in the anti-Xa cohort (p = 0.13), above goal 41.0\% vs. 17.3\% (p = 0.02), and below-goal 24.0\% versus 35.0\% of the time (p = 0.34). Minimum heparin rates in the {aPTT} cohort were 6.28 vs. 3.33 unit/kg/hour in the anti-Xa cohort (p = 0.07), and the maximum {UFH} rate was 18.77 unit/kg/hour vs. 15.48 unit/kg/hour (p = 0.10).

{DESIGN} {AND} {SETTINGS}: Retrospective single institution study.
{PATIENTS}: Retrospective record review of 62 pediatric patients supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation from 2009 to 2011.
{INTERVENTIONS}: Data on standard demographic characteristics, indications for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, activated clotting time measurements, anti-Factor Xa measurements, and heparin infusion rate were collected. Generalized linear models were used to associate anti-Factor Xa concentrations and need for change of either entire circuit/membrane oxygenator secondary to thrombus formation.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Sixty-two patients met study inclusion criteria. No-circuit change was required in 45 of 62 patients. Of 62 patients, 17 required change of circuit/membrane oxygenator due to thrombus formation. Multivariate analysis of daily anti-Factor Xa measurements throughout duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support estimated a mean anti-Factor Xa concentration of 0.20 {IU}/{mL} (95\% {CI}, 0.16, 0.24) in no-complete-circuit group that was significantly higher than the estimated concentration of 0.13 {IU}/{mL} (95\% {CI}, 0.12, 0.14) in complete-circuit group (p = 0.001). A 0.01 {IU}/{mL} decrease in anti-Factor Xa increased odds of need for circuit/membrane oxygenator change by 5\% (odds ratio = 1.105; 95\% {CI}, 1.00, 1.10; p = 0.044). Based on the observed anti-Factor Xa concentrations, complete-circuit group had 41\% increased odds for requiring circuit/membrane oxygenator change compared with no-complete-circuit group (odds ratio = 1.41; 95\% {CI}, 1.01, 1.96; p = 0.044). Mean daily activated clotting time measurement (p = 0.192) was not different between groups, but mean daily heparin infusion rate (p {\textless} 0.001) was significantly different between the two groups.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Higher anti-Factor Xa concentrations were associated with freedom from circuit/membrane oxygenator change due to thrombus formation in pediatric patients during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Activated clotting time measurements did not differ significantly between groups with or without circuit/membrane oxygenator change. This is the first study to link anti-Factor Xa concentrations with a clinically relevant measure of thrombosis in pediatric patients during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Further prospective study is warranted.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Monitoring warfarin with Fiix-prothrombin time (Fiix-{PT}), which is only affected by coagulation factors {II} and X, stabilizes anticoagulation and reduces thromboembolism compared to {PT}/{INR} monitoring. We compared outcome in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation ({NVAF}) patients treated with Fiix-warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants ({DOACs}), or {PT}-warfarin.
{METHODS}: A systematic efficacy and safety assessment by retrieving data from the Fiix trial and the four major phase {III} {DOAC} trials in {NVAF}. Prespecified outcomes included stroke and systemic embolism ({SSE}), {SSE} and myocardial infarction ({MI}), major bleeding ({MB}), composite major vascular events ({SSEMI} and {MB}; {CMVE}), and deaths. We calculated relative risk, 95\% {CI}, and 95\% confidence limits ({CL}) for each outcome and performed meta-analysis using fixed- and random-effects modeling.
{RESULTS}: There were 613 and 628 observation years with Fiix-warfarin and {PT}-warfarin in the Fiix trial, and 70 628 and 57 962 with {DOACs} and {PT}-warfarin in {DOAC} trials. Populations were comparable although death rates were lower in the Fiix trial. Compared to pooled {PT}-warfarin, Fiix-warfarin reduced {SSE} ({RR} 0.54;95\% {CI} 0.26-1.10/95\% {CL} {\textless}1.00), {SSEMI} (0.51;0.26-0.99/{\textless}0.90), {MB} ({RR} 0.63;0.37-1.07/{\textless}0.99), and {CMVE} ({RR} 0.66;0.43-1.00/{\textless}0.94). Vascular death was lower ({RR} 0.13;0.04-0.47/{\textless}0.42). Compared to pooled {DOACs}, Fiix-warfarin consistently had lower point estimates for the {RR} for efficacy and safety, but only significant for lower death rates (vascular death {RR} 0.14;0.04-0.49/{\textless}0.43). Meta-analysis comparing Fiix-warfarin and {DOACs} with {PT}-warfarin consistently found Fiix-warfarin to have the lowest point estimates for efficacy.
{CONCLUSION}: Monitoring warfarin with Fiix-{PT} reduces risk of vascular events in {NVAF} patients as much as {DOACs}. Warfarin monitored with Fiix-{PT} is an improved anticoagulant.},

{METHODS}: Data for 2014-2016 from an integrated health care information system of a single hospital were analyzed. Based on their warfarin dosage fluctuation ({WDF}), defined as the standard deviation of all prescribed warfarin dosages divided by the mean dosage, the patients were classified into Groups 1 (0-0.10), 2 (0.10-0.20), and 3 ({\textgreater}0.20). Target and in-range {INRs} were 2.0-2.5 and 1.5-3.0, respectively. Based on time in therapeutic range ({TTR}), patients were also categorized into Groups 1 ({\textless}0.6), 2 (0.6-0.9), and 3 ({\textgreater}0.9). The primary outcome was emergency department visits for bleeding or thromboembolism ({TE}) events.
{RESULTS}: Eighty-three events were retrieved from 17,397 records (1834 patients). Annual incidence rates were 0.9\%, 2.5\%, and 4.5\% for {WDF} Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05), and 2.3\%, 1.7\%, and 1.7\% for {TTR} Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p = 0.41).

	abstract = {Objectives
This study sought to determine the frequency, incidence rates over time, association with mortality, and potential risk factors for hemocompatibility-related adverse events ({HRAEs}) occurring during venoarterial-extracorporeal life support ({VA}-{ECLS}).
Background
{HRAEs} are common complications of {VA}-{ECLS}. Studies examining relevant clinical predictors and the association of {HRAEs} with survival are limited by small sample size and single-center setting.
Methods
We queried adult patients supported with {VA}-{ECLS} from 2010 to 2017 in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization database to assess the impact of {HRAEs} on in-hospital mortality.
Results
Among 11,984 adults meeting study inclusion, 8,457 {HRAEs} occurred; 62.1\% were bleeding events. The {HRAE} rate decreased significantly over the study period (p trend {\textless}0.001), but rates of medical bleeding and ischemic stroke remained stable. {HRAEs} had a cumulative association with mortality in adjusted analysis: 1 event, odds ratio ({OR}) of 1.43; 2 events, {OR} of 1.86; ≥3 events, {OR} of 3.27 (p {\textless} 0.001 for all). {HRAEs} most strongly associated with mortality were medical bleeding, including intracranial ({OR}: 7.71), pulmonary ({OR}: 3.08), and gastrointestinal ({OR}: 1.95) hemorrhage and ischemic stroke ({OR}: 2.31); p {\textless} 0.001 for all. Risk factors included the following: for bleeding: older age, lower {pH}, and female sex; for thrombosis: younger age, male sex, Asian race, and non-polymethylpentene oxygenator; and for both: time on {ECLS}, central cannulation, and renal failure.
Conclusions
Although decreasing, {HRAEs} remain common during {VA}-{ECLS} and have a cumulative association with survival. Bleeding events are twice as common as thrombotic events, with a hierarchy of {HRAEs} influencing survival. Differential risk factors for bleeding and thrombotic complications exist and raise the possibility of a tailored approach to {ECLS} management.},

The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalisability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ({STROBE}) initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September, 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of {STROBE} contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the {STROBE} statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles.18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies.A detailed explanation and elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the websites of {PLoS} Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology.

        Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}) is a potentially lifesaving procedure in acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) due to {COVID}-19.

        Evaluation of {ICH} occurrence rate, parameters of coagulation and anticoagulation strategies, inflammation, and {ICU} survival. {COVID}-19 and non-{COVID}-19 {ARDS} patients showed comparable disease severity regarding Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, while the oxygenation index before {ECMO} cannulation was higher in the {COVID} group (82 vs 65 mm Hg). Overall, {ICH} of any severity occurred in 29 of 142 {COVID}-19 patients (20\%) versus four of 68 patients in the control {ECMO} group (6\%). Fifteen of those 29 {ICH} events in the {COVID}-19 group were classified as major (52\%) including nine fatal cases (9/29, 31\%). In the control group, there was only one major {ICH} event (1/4, 25\%). The adjusted subhazard ratio for the occurrence of an {ICH} in the {COVID}-19 group was 5.82 (97.5\% {CI}, 1.9–17.8; p = 0.002). The overall {ICU} mortality in the presence of {ICH} of any severity was 88\%.
        {CONCLUSIONS}: 
        This retrospective multicenter analysis showed a six-fold increased adjusted risk for {ICH} and a 3.5-fold increased incidence of {ICH} in {COVID}-19 patients on {ECMO}. Prospective studies are needed to confirm this observation and to determine whether the bleeding risk can be reduced by adjusting anticoagulation strategies.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: 
        Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a life-sustaining therapy for severe respiratory failure. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuits require systemic anticoagulation that creates a delicate balance between circuit-related thrombosis and bleeding-related complications. Although unfractionated heparin is most widely used anticoagulant, alternative agents such as bivalirudin have been used. We sought to compare extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit thrombosis and bleeding-related outcomes in respiratory failure patients receiving either unfractionated heparin or bivalirudin for anticoagulation on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.
        {DESIGN}: 
        Retrospective cohort study.
        {SETTING}: 
        Single-center, cardiothoracic {ICU}.
        {PATIENTS}: 
        Consecutive patients requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation who were maintained on anticoagulation between 2013 and 2020.
        {INTERNVENTIONS}: 
        {IV} bivalirudin or {IV} unfractionated heparin.
        {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: 
        Primary outcomes were the presence of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in-circuit–related thrombotic complications and volume of blood products administered during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation duration. One hundred sixty-two patients receiving unfractionated heparin were compared with 133 patients receiving bivalirudin for anticoagulation on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In patients receiving bivalirudin, there was an overall decrease in the number of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit thrombotic complications (p {\textless} 0.005) and a significant increase in time to circuit thrombosis (p = 0.007). Multivariable Cox regression found that heparin was associated with a significant increase in risk of clots (Exp[B] = 2.31, p = 0.001). Patients who received bivalirudin received significantly less volume of packed {RBCs}, fresh frozen plasma, and platelet transfusion (p {\textless} 0.001 for each). There was a significant decrease in the number major bleeding events in patients receiving bivalirudin, 40.7\% versus 11.7\%, p {\textless} 0.001.
        {CONCLUSIONS}: 
        Patients receiving bivalirudin for systemic anticoagulation on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation experienced a decrease in the number of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit-related thrombotic events as well as a significant decrease in volume of blood products administered.},

        To investigate platelet pathophysiology associated with pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}).
        {DESIGN}: 
        Prospective observational study of neonatal and pediatric {ECMO} patients from September 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019.
        {SETTING}: 
        The {PICU} in a large tertiary referral pediatric {ECMO} center.
        {PATIENTS}: 
        Eighty-seven neonates and children ({\textless} 18 yr) supported by {ECMO}.
        {INTERVENTIONS}: 
        None.
        {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: 
        Arterial blood samples were collected on days 1, 2, and 5 of {ECMO} and were analyzed by whole blood flow cytometry. Corresponding clinical data for each patient was also recorded. A total of 87 patients were recruited (median age, 65 d; interquartile range [{IQR}], 7 d to 4 yr). The median duration of {ECMO} was 5 days ({IQR}, 3–8 d) with a median length of stay in {PICU} and hospital of 18 days ({IQR}, 10–29 d) and 35 days ({IQR}, 19–75 d), respectively. Forty-two patients (48\%) had at least one major bleed according to a priori determined definitions, and 12 patients (14\%) had at least one thrombotic event during {ECMO}. Platelet fibrinogen receptor expression decreased (median fluorescence intensity [{MFI}], 29,256 vs 26,544; p = 0.0005), while von Willebrand Factor expression increased ({MFI}: 7,620 vs 8,829; p = 0.0459) from day 2 to day 5 of {ECMO}. Platelet response to agonist, Thrombin Receptor Activator Peptide 6, also decreased from day 2 to day 5 of {ECMO}, as measured by binding with anti-P-selectin, {PAC}-1 (binds activated {GPIIb}/{IIIa}), and anti-{CD}63 monoclonal antibodies (P-selectin area under the curve [{AUC}]: 63.46 vs 42.82, respectively, p = 0.0022; {PAC}-1 {AUC}: 93.75 vs 74.46, p = 0.0191; {CD}63 {AUC}: 55.69 vs 41.76, p = 0.0020).
        {CONCLUSIONS}: 
        The loss of platelet response over time may contribute to bleeding during {ECMO}. These novel insights may be useful in understanding mechanisms of bleeding in pediatric {ECMO} and monitoring platelet markers clinically could allow for prediction or early detection of bleeding and thrombosis.},

	abstract = {Data in the natural sciences are often in the form of percentages or proportions that are continuous and bounded by 0 and 1. Statistical analysis assuming a normal error structure can produce biased and incorrect estimates when data are doubly bounded. Beta regression uses an error structure appropriate for such data. We conducted a literature review of percent and proportion data from 2004 to 2020 to determine the types of analyses used for (0, 1) bounded data. Our literature review showed that before 2012, angular transformations accounted for 93\% of analyses of proportion or percent data. After 2012, angular transformation accounted for 52\% of analyses and beta regression accounted for 14\% of analyses. We compared a linear model with angular transformation with beta regression using data from two fields of the natural sciences that produce continuous, bounded data: biogeochemistry and ecological elemental composition. We found little difference in model diagnostics, likelihood ratios, and p-values between the two models. However, we found substantially different coefficient estimates from the back-calculated beta regression and angular transformation models. Beta regression provides reliable parameter estimates in natural science studies where effect sizes are considered as important as hypothesis testing.},
