Interventions such as ischaemic pre and postconditioning protect against myocardial ischaemia reperfusion injury. Certain anaesthesia drugs and opioids can produce the same effects, which led to an initial ﬂurry of excitement given the extensive use of these drugs in surgery. The underlying mechanisms have since been extensively studied in experimental animal models but attempts to translate these ﬁndings to clinical settings have resulted in contradictory results. There are a number of reasons for this such as dose response, the intensity of the ischaemic stimulus applied, the duration of ischaemia and lost or diminished cardioprotection in common co-morbidities such as diabetes and senescence. This review focuses on current knowledge regarding myocardial ischaemia reperfusion injury and cardioprotective interventions both in experimental animal studies and in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Whilst there has been a reduction in the prevalence of peripheral vascular disease worldwide, a signiﬁcant proportion of the world’s growing population is still affected by disease of the aorta, carotid, iliac and lower limb arteries. These if left untreated can result in severe morbidity and mortality. However vascular surgery, the main deﬁnitive treatment for such conditions, is associated with subsequent injury to vital organs including the kidneys, heart, brain, intestines and lungs, with a consequent increase in both morbidity and mortality. The current thinking is that the underlying mechanism of injury is direct organ ischaemia and ischaemia induced formation of free radicals, cytokine release and mitochondrial failure. Various methods to alleviate such injuries have been investigated including pre- and postconditioning strategies, pharmacological therapies including volatile anaesthetic and alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist drugs and more recently remote conditioning strategies. Although these interventions have demonstrated some reduction in the biomarkers for organ injury, attempts to translate these beneﬁts into clinical practice have not been successful in terms of morbidity, mortality or length of hospital stay. For this reason, further research is needed in this area to facilitate the translation of the potential interventional beneﬁts from bench to bedside.},

	title = {Detecting and correcting patient-ventilator asynchronies},
	abstract = {Mechanical ventilation ({MV}) is a life supporting treatment that, unfortunately, can be associated with several complications such as ventilator-induced lung injury, ventilator associated pneumonia or ventilation induced diaphragm dysfunction ({VIDD})[1]. Clinicians generally try to provide assisted/supported ventilation instead of fully controlled ventilation in critically ill patients [2]. This strategy aims at avoiding diaphragmatic atrophy [3]. This requires harmonious synchronization and matching with patient’s demands in terms of ventilator needs. Asynchrony between the patient and the ventilator occurs when there is a mismatch between the patient and ventilator in terms of breath delivery timing. Some asynchrony is inevitable because of the mechanical and electrical delays existing within the complex patient-ventilator loop. Gross asynchronies as those where the mismatch between the breath delivery and the patient effort is huge, such as auto-triggering or missing effort. Some asynchronies can cause or be associated with discomfort and dyspnea and/or increased need for sedative and paralytic agents but this is not the case for all of them [4] and asynchronies may even be caused by deeper levels of sedation [5]. This is why a classification based on their mechanism appears useful. A high incidence of asynchrony is associated with prolonged {MV} and intensive care unit ({ICU}) length of stay [6,7] and with mortality [8]. Thus, it seems intuitively important to enhance the detection of asynchronies and to adapt the ventilator assistance, although we have no direct evidence that reducing asynchrony improve outcome.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives Increasing experimental evidence suggests that acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) may promote {AKI}. The primary objective of this study was to assess {ARDS} as a risk factor for {AKI} in critically ill patients. Design, setting, participants, \& measurements This was an observational study on a prospective database fed by 18 intensive care units ({ICUs}). Patients with {ICU} stays .24 hours were enrolled over a 14-year period. {ARDS} was deﬁned using the Berlin criteria and {AKI} was deﬁned using the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease criteria. Patients with {AKI} before {ARDS} onset were excluded.
Results This study enrolled 8029 patients, including 1879 patients with {ARDS}. {AKI} occurred in 31.3\% of patients and was more common in patients with {ARDS} (44.3\% versus 27.4\% in patients without {ARDS}; P,0.001). After adjustment for confounders, both mechanical ventilation without {ARDS} (odds ratio [{OR}], 4.34; 95\% conﬁdence interval [95\% {CI}], 3.71 to 5.10) and {ARDS} ({OR}, 11.01; 95\% {CI}, 6.83 to 17.73) were independently associated with {AKI}. Hospital mortality was 14.2\% (n=1140) and was higher in patients with {ARDS} (27.9\% versus 10.0\% in patients without {ARDS}; P,0.001) and in patients with {AKI} (27.6\% versus 8.1\% in those without {AKI}; P,0.001). {AKI} was associated with higher mortality in patients with {ARDS} (42.3\% versus 20.2\%; P,0.001).

Up to now, according to oﬃcial data released by the Chinese health commission, the number of newly diagnosed patients has been declining, and the epidemic is gradually being controlled. Although most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis after infection, some patients developed severe and die from multiple organ complications.

	abstract = {Rationale:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) is frequently associated with hemodynamic instability which appears as the main factor associated with mortality. Shock is driven by pulmonary hypertension, deleterious effects of mechanical ventilation ({MV}) on right ventricular ({RV}) function, and associated-sepsis. Hemodynamic effects of ven‑tilation are due to changes in pleural pressure (Ppl) and changes in transpulmonary pressure ({TP}). {TP} affects {RV} after‑load, whereas changes in Ppl affect venous return. Tidal forces and positive end-expiratory pressure ({PEEP}) increase pulmonary vascular resistance ({PVR}) in direct proportion to their effects on mean airway pressure ({mPaw}). The acutely injured lung has a reduced capacity to accommodate flowing blood and increases of blood flow accentuate fluid filtration. The dynamics of vascular pressure may contribute to ventilator-induced injury ({VILI}). In order to optimize perfusion, improve gas exchange, and minimize {VILI} risk, monitoring hemodynamics is important. Results:  During passive ventilation pulse pressure variations are a predictor of fluid responsiveness when conditions to ensure its validity are observed, but may also reflect afterload effects of {MV}. Central venous pressure can be helpful to monitor the response of {RV} function to treatment. Echocardiography is suitable to visualize the {RV} and to detect acute cor pulmonale ({ACP}), which occurs in 20–25 \% of cases. Inserting a pulmonary artery catheter may be useful to measure/calculate pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance, and cardiac output. These last two indexes may be misleading, however, in cases of West zones 2 or 1 and tricuspid regurgitation associated with {RV} dilatation. Transpulmonary thermodilution may be useful to evaluate extravascular lung water and the pulmonary vascular permeability index. To ensure adequate intravascular volume is the first goal of hemodynamic support in patients with shock. The benefit and risk balance of fluid expansion has to be carefully evaluated since it may improve systemic perfusion but also may decrease ventilator-free days, increase pulmonary edema, and promote {RV} failure. {ACP} can be prevented or treated by applying {RV} protective {MV} (low driving pressure, limited hypercapnia, {PEEP} adapted to lung recruitability) and by prone positioning. In cases of shock that do not respond to intravascular fluid administration, norepinephrine infusion and vasodilators inhalation may improve {RV} function. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}) has the potential to be the cause of, as well as a remedy for, hemodynamic problems. Continuous thermodi‑lution-based and pulse contour analysis-based cardiac output monitoring are not recommended in patients treated with {ECMO}, since the results are frequently inaccurate. Extracorporeal {CO}2 removal, which could have the capability to reduce hypercapnia/acidosis-induced {ACP}, cannot currently be recommended because of the lack of sufficient data.},

	abstract = {Pressure controlled ventilation is a common mode of ventilation used to manage both adult and pediatric populations. However, there is very little evidence that distinguishes the efﬁcacy of pressure controlled ventilation over that of volume controlled ventilation in the adult population. This gap in the literature may be due to the absence of a consistent and systematic algorithm for managing pressure controlled ventilation. This article provides a brief overview of the applications of both pressure controlled ventilation and volume controlled ventilation and proposes an algorithmic approach to the management of patients receiving pressure controlled ventilation. This algorithmic approach highlights the need for clinicians to have a comprehensive conceptual understanding of mechanical ventilation, pulmonary physiology, and interpretation of ventilator graphics in order to best care for patients receiving pressure controlled ventilation. The objective of identifying a systematic approach to managing pressure controlled ventilation is to provide a more generalizable and equitable approach to management of the {ICU} patient. Ideally, a consistent approach to managing pressure controlled ventilation in the adult population will glean more reliable information regarding actual patient outcomes, as well as the efﬁcacy of pressure controlled ventilation when compared to volume controlled ventilation.},

	abstract = {Bedside measurement of respiratory mechanics allows to closely monitor the lung function in critically ill patients. The two fundamental parameters describing the respiratory system mechanics are resistance and compliance. Resistance of the respiratory system describes the opposition to gas flow during inspiration. During volumecontrolled ventilation, resistance can be calculated as the ratio between the peak to plateau pressure drop and the resulting flow rate. Compliance describes the elastic property of the respiratory system, comprising the lung and the chest wall. It is the ratio between a change in volume (i.e. tidal volume) and the corresponding change in pressure, calculated as the difference between plateau pressure and total positive end-expiratory pressure, measured by end-inspiratory and end-expiratory manual occlusion, respectively. In this review, we describe how to measure respiratory mechanics at the bedside, starting from the physiological background of the equation of motion of the respiratory system.},

	abstract = {Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction due to dysregulated response to infection. Patients with sepsis exhibit wide heterogeneity stemming from genetic, molecular, and clinical factors as well as differences in pathogens, creating challenges for the development of effective treatments. Several gaps in knowledge also contribute: (i) biomarkers that identify patients likely to benefit from specific treatments are unknown; (ii) therapeutic dose and duration is often poorly understood; and (iii) short-term mortality, a common outcome measure, is frequently criticized for being insensitive. To date, the majority of sepsis trials use traditional design features, and have largely failed to identify new treatments with incremental benefit over standard of care. Traditional trials are also frequently conducted as part of a drug evaluation process that is segmented into several phases, each requiring separate trials, with a long time delay from inception through design and execution to incorporation of results into clinical practice. By contrast, adaptive clinical trial designs facilitate the evaluation of several candidate treatments simultaneously, learn from emergent discoveries during the course of the trial, and can be structured efficiently to lead to more timely conclusions compared to traditional trial designs. Adoption of new treatments in clinical practice can be accelerated if these trials are incorporated in electronic health records as part of a learning health system. In this review, we discuss challenges in the evaluation of treatments for sepsis, and explore potential benefits and weaknesses of recent advances in adaptive trial methodologies to address these challenges.},

The aim of this work was to determine how Bayesian adaptive designs can be constructed for phase {III} clinical trials in critical care, and to assess the influence that Bayesian designs would have on trial efficiency and study results.
Methods: We re-designed the High Frequency {OSCillation} in Acute Respiratory distress syndrome ({OSCAR}) trial using Bayesian adaptive design methods, to allow for the possibility of early stopping for success or futility. We constructed several alternative designs and studied their operating characteristics via simulation. We then performed virtual re-executions by applying the Bayesian adaptive designs using the {OSCAR} data to demonstrate the practical applicability of the designs.
Results: We constructed five alternative Bayesian adaptive designs and identified a preferred design based on the simulated operating characteristics, which had similar power to the original design but recruited fewer patients on average. The virtual re-executions showed the Bayesian sequential approach and original {OSCAR} trial yielded similar trial conclusions. However, using a Bayesian sequential design could have led to a reduced sample size and earlier completion of the trial.
Conclusions: Using the {OSCAR} trial as an example, this case study found that Bayesian adaptive designs can be constructed for phase {III} critical care trials. If the {OSCAR} trial had been run using one of the proposed Bayesian adaptive designs, it would have terminated at a smaller sample size with fewer deaths in the trial, whilst reaching the same conclusions. We recommend the wider use of Bayesian adaptive approaches in phase {III} clinical trials. Trial registration: {OSCAR} Trial registration {ISRCTN}, {ISRCTN}10416500.

	abstract = {Objectives  We sought to understand why randomised controlled trials in septic shock have failed to demonstrate effectiveness in the face of improving overall outcomes for patients and seemingly promising results of early phase trials of interventions. Design  We performed a retrospective analysis of large critical care trials of severe sepsis and septic shock. Data were collected from the primary trial manuscripts, prepublished statistical plans or by direct communication with corresponding authors. Setting  Critical care randomised control trials in severe sepsis and septic shock. Participants  14 619 patients randomised in 13 trials published between 2005 and 2015, enrolling greater than 500 patients and powered to a primary outcome of mortality. Intervention  Multiple interventions including the evaluation of treatment strategies and novel therapeutics. Primary and secondary outcome measures Our primary outcome measure was the difference between the anticipated and actual control arm mortality. Secondary analysis examined the actual effect size and the anticipated effect size employed in sample size calculation.
Results  In this post hoc analysis of 13 trials with 14 619 patients randomised, we highlight a global tendency to overestimate control arm mortality in estimating sample size (absolute difference 9.8\%, 95\% {CI} −14.7\% to −5.0\%, p{\textless}0.001). When we compared anticipated and actual effect size of a treatment, there was also a substantial overestimation in proposed values (absolute difference 7.4\%, 95\% {CI} −9.0\% to −5.8\%, p{\textless}0.0001).
Conclusions  An interpretation of our results is that trials are consistently underpowered in the planning phase by employing erroneous variables to calculate a satisfactory sample size. Our analysis cannot establish if, given a larger sample size, a trial would have had a positive result. It is disappointing so many promising phase {II} results have not translated into durable phase {III} outcomes. It is possible that our current framework has biased us towards discounting potentially life-saving treatments.},

              . We systematically evaluated the use of transthoracic echocardiography in the assessment of dynamic markers of preload to predict fluid responsiveness in the critically ill adult patient.
              Methods
              . Studies in the critically ill using transthoracic echocardiography ({TTE}) to predict a response in stroke volume or cardiac output to a fluid load were selected. Selection was limited to English language and adult patients. Studies on patients with an open thorax or abdomen were excluded.
              Results
              . The predictive power of diagnostic accuracy of inferior vena cava diameter and transaortic Doppler signal changes with the respiratory cycle or passive leg raising in mechanically ventilated patients was strong throughout the articles reviewed. Limitations of the technique relate to patient tolerance of the procedure, adequacy of acoustic windows, and operator skill.
              Conclusions
              . Transthoracic echocardiographic techniques accurately predict fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients. Discriminative power is not affected by the technique selected.},

The {GDG} comprises representatives from patient/carer groups (British Liver Trust, Liver4life, {PBC} Foundation and {PSC} Support), elected members of the {BSG} liver section (including representatives from Scotland and Wales), British Association for the Study of the Liver ({BASL}), Specialist Advisory Committee in Clinical Biochemistry/Royal College of Pathology and Association for Clinical Biochemistry, British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition ({BSPGHAN}), Public Health England (implementation and screening), Royal College of General Practice, British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiologists ({BSGAR}) and Society of Acute Medicine. The quality of evidence and grading of recommendations was appraised using the {AGREE} {II} tool. These guidelines deal specifically with the management of abnormal liver blood tests in children and adults in both primary and secondary care under the following subheadings: (1) What constitutes an abnormal liver blood test? (2) What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel? (3) When should liver blood tests be checked? (4) Does the extent and duration of abnormal liver blood tests determine subsequent investigation? (5) Response to abnormal liver blood tests.

	abstract = {Background: Enteral nutrition delivery in the critically ill is frequently interrupted for surgical and airway procedures to avoid aspiration of stomach contents. Recurrent fasting leads to under delivery of enteral nutrition and this underfeeding is associated with worse outcomes. International fasting recommendations do not provide guidance for intubated patients receiving enteral nutrition. This study aimed to gain a detailed perspective of {UK} critical care fasting practices.
Methods: A web-based survey was sent to 232 {UK} intensive care units consisting of questions relating to fasting practices, presence of guidelines, average fasting times for common procedures and dietitian time per intensive care unit bed.
Results: A total of 176 intensive care units responded. Only 20\% of units had guidelines and respondents stated that they were not consistently adhered to (mean compliance 66\%). Units with greater dietetic involvement were more likely to have guidelines (p ¼ 0.04). Fasting times were shorter for abdominal surgery (p ¼ 0.002), non-abdominal surgery (p ¼ 0.016) and radiology (p ¼ 0.015) if a guideline was present. Fasting for extubation and tracheostomy was similar irrespective of the presence of a guideline. Considerable variation in fasting times was reported, usually due to inconsistencies in clinical decision-making.
Conclusions: This survey of national practice demonstrates that fasting times are varied and inconsistent, which may lead to under-delivery of enteral nutrition. More dietetic input was associated with increased likelihood of a fasting guideline.},

	abstract = {Purpose:  Discharge from an intensive care unit ({ICU}) out of hours is common. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the association between time of discharge and mortality/{ICU} readmission.
Methods:  We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Knowledge, {CINAHL}, the Cochrane Library and {OpenGrey} to June 2017. We included studies reporting in-hospital mortality and/or {ICU} readmission rates by {ICU} discharge “out-of-hours” and “in-hours”. Inclusion was limited to patients aged ≥ 16 years discharged alive from a non-specialist {ICU} to a lower level of hospital care. Studies restricted to specific diseases were excluded. We assessed study quality using the Newcastle Ottowa Scale. We extracted published data, summarising using a random-effects meta-analysis.
Results:  Our searches identified 1961 studies. We included unadjusted data from 1,191,178 patients from 18 cohort studies (presenting data from 1994 to 2014). “Out of hours” had multiple definitions, beginning between 16:00 and 22:00 and ending between 05:59 and 09:00. Patients discharged out of hours had higher in-hospital mortality [relative risk (95\% {CI}) 1.39 (1.24, 1.57) p {\textless} 0.0001] and readmission rates [1·30 (1.19, 1.42), p {\textless} 0.001] than patients discharged in hours. Heterogeneity was high (I2 90.1\% for mortality and 90.2\% for readmission), resulting from differences in effect size rather than the presence of an effect.
Conclusions:  Out-of-hours discharge from an {ICU} is strongly associated with both in-hospital death and {ICU} readmission. These effects persisted across all definitions of “out of hours” and across healthcare systems in different geographical locations. Whether these increases in mortality and readmission result from patient differences, differences in care, or a combination remains unclear.},

	abstract = {Introduction: In critically ill patients, re-intubation is common and may be a high-risk procedure. Anticipating a difficult airway and identifying high-risk patients can allow time for life-saving preparation. Unfortunately, prospective studies have not compared the difficulty or complication rates associated with reintubation in this population.
Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective registry of in-hospital emergency airway management, focusing on patients that underwent multiple out-of-operating room intubations during a single hospitalization. Our main outcomes of interest were technical difficulty of intubation (number of attempts, need for adjuncts to direct laryngoscopy, best Cormack-Lehane grade and training level of final intubator) and the frequency of procedural complications (aspiration, arrhythmia, airway trauma, new hypotension, new hypoxia, esophageal intubation and cardiac arrest). We compared the cohort of reintubated patients to a matched cohort of singly intubated patients and compared each repeatedly intubated patient’s first and last intubation.
Results: Our registry included 1053 patients, of which 151 patients (14\%) were repeatedly intubated (median two per patient). Complications were significantly more common during last intubation compared to first (13\% versus 5\%, P = 0.02). The most common complications were hypotension (41\%) and hypoxia (35\%). These occurred despite no difference in any measure of technical difficultly across intubations.
Conclusion: In this cohort of reintubated patients, clinically important procedural complications were significantly more common on last intubation compared to first.},

	abstract = {Background:  Point-of-care ultrasonography ({POCUS}) is a widely used tool in emergency and critical care settings, useful in the decision-making process as well as in interventional guidance. While having an impressive diagnostic accuracy in the hands of highly skilled operators, inexperienced practitioners must be aware of some common misinterpretations that may lead to wrong decisions at the bedside.
Objectives:  This article provides a revision list of common {POCUS} misdiagnoses usually found in practice and offers useful tips to recognize and avoid them. Discussion:  The following aspects were selected and reviewed: pericardial effusion vs. pleural vs. ascites vs. epicardial fat; right ventricle dilation in acute pulmonary embolism and inferior vena cava for volume status assessment in cardiac ultrasound; lung point and lung pulse misinterpretations and mirror artifacts vs. lung consolidations in lung ultrasound; peritoneal fluid vs. the stomach and a critical appraisal of gallbladder signs of acute cholecystitis in abdominal ultrasound; the rouleaux phenomenon vs. deep vein thrombosis or acute right strain in vascular ultrasound.
Conclusions:  Following some rules in technique and interpretation, and always integrating {POCUS} findings into the broader clinical context, most {POCUS} misdiagnosis can be avoided, and thus patients’ safety can be enhanced. Being aware of a list of common pitfalls may help to avoid misdiagnoses.},

Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of acute {PE}, based on a positive ventilation perfusion scan or computed tomography ({CT}) chest angiogram, were identified using the Duke University Hospital Database. Of these, 69 had echocardiograms within 24–48 h of the diagnosis that were suitable for offline analysis. Clinical features that were analyzed included age, gender, body mass index, vital signs and comorbidities. Echocardiographic parameters that were analyzed included left ventricular ({LV}) ejection fraction ({EF}), regional, free wall and global {RV} speckle-tracking strain, {RV} fraction area change ({RVFAC}), Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion ({TAPSE}), pulmonary artery acceleration time ({PAAT}) and {RV} myocardial performance (Tei) index. Univariable and multivariable regression statistical analysis models were used.
Results: Out of 69 patients with acute {PE}, the median age was 55 and 48 \% were female. The median body mass index ({BMI}) was 27 kg/m2. Twenty-nine percent of the cohort had a history of cancer, with a significant increase in cancer prevalence in non-survivors (57 \% vs 29 \%, p = 0.02). Clinical parameters including heart rate, respiratory rate, troponin T level, active malignancy, hypertension and {COPD} were higher among non-survivors when compared to survivors (p ≤ 0.05). Using univariable analysis, {NYHA} class {III} symptoms, hypoxemia on presentation, tachycardia, tachypnea, elevation in Troponin T, absence of hypertension, active malignancy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) were increased in non-survivors compared to survivors (p ≤ 0.05). In multivariable models, {RV} Tei Index, global and free (lateral) wall {RVLS} were found to be negatively associated with survival probability after adjusting for age, gender and systolic blood pressure (p ≤ 0.05).
Conclusion: The addition of echocardiographic assessment of {RV} function to clinical parameters improved the prediction of outcomes for patients with acute {PE}. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings.},

	abstract = {Background: The diagnosis of pneumothorax with a bedside lung ultrasound is a powerful methodology. The conventional lung ultrasound examination consists of a step-by-step procedure targeted towards the detection of four classic ultrasound signs, the lung sliding, the B lines, the lung point and the lung pulse. In most cases, a combination of these signs allows a safe diagnosis of pneumothorax. However, the widespread application of sonographic methodology in clinical practice has brought out unusual cases which raise new sonographic signs. The purpose of this article was to introduce some of these new signs that are described after the analysis of unusual and complex cases encountered during the clinical daily practice in an emergency department. Findings: The double lung point consists of the alternating patterns of sliding and non-sliding lung intermittently appearing at the two opposite sides of the scan. The septate pneumothorax allows B lines and lung pulse to be still visible in a condition of pneumothorax with absent sliding. In hydropneumothorax, the air/fluid border is imaged by lung ultrasound as the interposition between an anechoic space and a non-sliding A-pattern, a sign that may be named hydro-point. Conclusions: In bedside lung ultrasound, the operator should be aware and interpret double lung point, septate pneumothorax and hydro-point. The conventional diagnostic protocol of bedside lung ultrasound for pneumothorax should be occasionally adapted to such complex cases.},

	abstract = {Purpose:  On a regular basis, the intensivist encounters the patient who is difficult to wean from mechanical ventila‑tory support. The causes for failure to wean from mechanical ventilatory support are often multifactorial and involve a complex interplay between cardiac and pulmonary dysfunction. A potential application of point of care ultrasonogra‑phy relates to its utility in the process of weaning the patient from mechanical ventilatory support.
Methods:  This article reviews some applications of ultrasonography that may be relevant to the process of weaning from mechanical ventilatory support.
Results:  The authors have divided these applications of ultrasonography into four separate categories: the assess‑ment of cardiac, diaphragmatic, and lung function; and the identification of pleural effusion; which can all be evalu‑ated with ultrasonography during a dynamic process in which the intensivist is uniquely positioned to use ultra‑sonography at the point of care.
Conclusions:  Ultrasonography may have useful application during the weaning process from mechanical ventilatory support.},

From its traditional assessment of pleural effusions and masses, {LUS} has moved towards the revolutionary approach of imaging the pulmonary parenchyma, mainly as a point-of-care technique. Although limited by the presence of air, {LUS} has proved to be useful in the evaluation of many different acute and chronic conditions, from cardiogenic pulmonary edema to acute lung injury, from pneumothorax to pneumonia, from interstitial lung disease to pulmonary infarctions and contusions. It is especially valuable since it is a relatively easy-to-learn application of ultrasound, less technically demanding than other sonographic examinations. It is quick to perform, portable, repeatable, non-ionizing, independent from specific acoustic windows, and therefore suitable for a meaningful evaluation in many different settings, both inpatient and outpatient, in both acute and chronic conditions. In the next few years, point-of-care {LUS} is likely to become increasingly important in many different clinical settings, from the emergency department to the intensive care unit, from cardiology to pulmonology and nephrology wards.},

	abstract = {Background: This study assesses the potential of lung ultrasonography to diagnose acute respiratory failure.
Methods: This observational study was conducted in university-affiliated teaching-hospital {ICUs}. We performed ultrasonography on consecutive patients admitted to the {ICU} with acute respiratory failure, comparing lung ultrasonography results on initial presentation with the final diagnosis by the {ICU} team. Uncertain diagnoses and rare causes (frequency {\textless} 2\%) were excluded. We included 260 dyspneic patients with a definite diagnosis. Three items were assessed: artifacts (horizontal A lines or vertical B lines indicating interstitial syndrome), lung sliding, and alveolar consolidation and/or pleural effusion. Combined with venous analysis, these items were grouped to assess ultrasound profiles.
Results: Predominant A lines plus lung sliding indicated asthma (n ؍ 34) or {COPD} (n ؍ 49) with 89\% sensitivity and 97\% specificity. Multiple anterior diffuse B lines with lung sliding indicated pulmonary edema (n ؍ 64) with 97\% sensitivity and 95\% specificity. A normal anterior profile plus deep venous thrombosis indicated pulmonary embolism (n ؍ 21) with 81\% sensitivity and 99\% specificity. Anterior absent lung sliding plus A lines plus lung point indicated pneumothorax (n ؍ 9) with 81\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Anterior alveolar consolidations, anterior diffuse B lines with abolished lung sliding, anterior asymmetric interstitial patterns, posterior consolidations or effusions without anterior diffuse B lines indicated pneumonia (n ؍ 83) with 89\% sensitivity and 94\% specificity. The use of these profiles would have provided correct diagnoses in 90.5\% of cases.
Conclusions: Lung ultrasound can help the clinician make a rapid diagnosis in patients with acute respiratory failure, thus meeting the priority objective of saving time. ({CHEST} 2008; 134:117–125)},

Quantification of right ventricular systolic and diastolic performance by echocardiography is of paramount importance, given the prevalence of children with heart disease, particularly those with involvement of the right heart, such as single or systemic right ventricles, tetralogy of Fallot, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Identification of poor right ventricular performance can provide an opportunity to intervene. In this review, we will go through the different systolic and diastolic indices, as well as their application in practice. Quantification of right ventricular function is possible and should be routinely performed using a combination of different measures, taking into account each disease state. Quantification is extremely useful for individual patient follow-up. Laboratories should continue to strive to optimise reproducibility through quality improvement and quality assurance efforts in addition to investing in technology and training for new, promising techniques, such as three-dimensional echocardiography.},

	abstract = {Echocardiography is pivotal in the diagnosis and management of the shocked patient. Important characteristics in the setting of shock are that it is non-invasive and can be rapidly applied. In the acute situation a basic study often yields immediate results allowing for the initiation of therapy, while a follow-up advanced study brings the advantage of further refining the diagnosis and providing an in-depth hemodynamic assessment. Competency in basic critical care echocardiography is now regarded as a mandatory part of critical care training with clear guidelines available. The majority of pathologies found in shocked patients are readily identified using basic level 2D and M-mode echocardiography. A more comprehensive diagnosis can be achieved with advanced levels of competency, for which practice guidelines are also now available. Hemodynamic evaluation and ongoing monitoring are possible with advanced levels of competency, which includes the use of colour Doppler, spectral Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging and occasionally the use of more recent technological advances such as 3D or speckled tracking. The four core types of shock—cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive, and vasoplegic—can readily be identified by echocardiography. Even within each of the main headings contained in the shock classification, a variety of pathologies may be the cause and echocardiography will differentiate which of these is responsible. Increasingly, as a result of more complex and elderly patients, the shock may be multifactorial, such as a combination of cardiogenic and septic shock or hypovolemia and ventricular outflow obstruction. The diagnostic benefit of echocardiography in the shocked patient is obvious. The increasing prevalence of critical care physicians experienced in advanced techniques means echocardiography often supplants the need for more invasive hemodynamic assessment and monitoring in shock.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Assessing left ventricular ({LV}) systolic function in a rapid and reliable way can be challenging in the critically ill patient. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of, as well as the association between, commonly used {LV} systolic parameters, by using serial transthoracic echocardiography ({TTE}).
Methods: Fifty patients with shock and mechanical ventilation were included. {TTE} examinations were performed daily for a total of 7 days. Methods used to assess {LV} systolic function were visually estimated, “eyeball” ejection fraction ({EBEF}), the Simpson single-plane method, mean atrioventricular plane displacement ({AVPDm}), septal tissue velocity imaging ({TDIs}), and velocity time integral in the left ventricular outflow tract ({VTI}).
Results: {EBEF}, {AVPDm}, {TDIs}, {VTI}, and the Simpson were obtained in 100\%, 100\%, 99\%, 95\% and 93\%, respectively, of all possible examinations. The correlations between the Simpson and {EBEF} showed r values for all 7 days ranging from 0.79 to 0.95 (P {\textless} 0.01). the Simpson correlations with the other {LV} parameters showed substantial variation over time, with the poorest results seen for {TDIs} and {AVPDm}. The repeatability was best for {VTI} (interobserver coefficient of variation ({CV}) 4.8\%, and intraobserver {CV}, 3.1\%), and {AVPDm} (5.3\% and 4.4\%, respectively), and worst for the Simpson method (8.2\% and 10.6\%, respectively).
Conclusions: {EBEF} and {AVPDm} provided the best, and Simpson, the worst feasibility when assessing {LV} systolic function in a population of mechanically ventilated, hemodynamically unstable patients. Additionally, the Simpson showed the poorest repeatability. We suggest that {EBEF} can be used instead of single-plane Simpson when assessing {LV} ejection fraction in this category of patients. {TDIs} and {AVPDm}, as markers of longitudinal function of the {LV}, are not interchangeable with {LV} ejection fraction.},

Our data provides evidence for widespread community circulation of {SARS}-{CoV}2 in early February 2020 and into March that was undetected at the time due to restrictive case definitions informing testing policy.

	shorttitle = {Community prevalence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus in England during May 2020},
	abstract = {Background England has experienced one of the highest rates of confirmed {COVID}-19 mortality in the world. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus has circulated in hospitals, care homes and the community since January 2020. Our current epidemiological knowledge is largely informed by clinical cases with far less understanding of community transmission.
Methods The {REal}-time Assessment of Community Transmission ({REACT}) study is a nationally representative prevalence survey of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus swab-positivity in the community in England. We recruited participants regardless of symptom status.
Results We found 159 positives from 120,610 swabs giving an average prevalence of 0.13\% (95\% {CI}: 0.11\%,0.15\%) from 1st May to 1st June 2020. We showed decreasing prevalence with a halving time of 8.6 (6.2, 13.6) days, implying an overall reproduction number R of 0.57 (0.45, 0.72). Adults aged 18 to 24 yrs had the highest swab-positivity rates, while those {\textgreater}64 yrs had the lowest. Of the 126 participants who tested positive with known symptom status in the week prior to their swab, 39 reported symptoms while 87 did not, giving an estimate that 69\% (61\%,76\%) of people were symptom-free for the 7 days prior testing positive in our community sample. Symptoms strongly associated with swab-positivity were: nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhoea, blocked nose, loss of smell, loss of taste, headache, chills and severe fatigue. Recent contact with a known {COVID}-19 case was associated with odds of 24 (16, 38) for swab-positivity. Compared with non-key workers, odds of swab-positivity were 7.7 (2.4, 25) among care home (long-term care facilities) workers and 5.2 (2.9, 9.3) among health care workers. However, some of the excess risk associated with key worker status was explained by recent contact with {COVID}-19 cases. We found no strong evidence for geographical variability in positive swab results.
Conclusion Our results provide a reliable baseline against which the impact of subsequent relaxation of lockdown can be assessed to inform future public health efforts to control transmission.},

North West London saw an early surge in {COVID}-19 admissions, which urgently threatened the capacity of some of its intensive care units even before the {UK} government announced lockdown. The pre-existing relationships and culture within the network allowed its members to unite and work rapidly to develop agile and innovative solutions, protecting any individual unit from becoming overwhelmed, and ultimately protecting its patients. Within a short 50-day period 223 patients were transferred within the network to distribute pressures. This unprecedented number of critical care transfers, combined with the creation of extra capacity and new pathways, allowed the region to continue to offer timely and unrationed access to critical care for all patients who would benefit from admission. This extraordinary response is a testament to the power and benefits of a regionally networked approach to critical care, and the lessons learned may benefit other healthcare providers, managers and policy makers, especially in regions currently facing new outbreaks of {COVID}-19.},

	abstract = {Background
Risk prediction models are used in critical care for risk stratification, summarising and communicating risk, supporting clinical decision-making and benchmarking performance. However, they require validation before they can be used with confidence, ideally using independently collected data from a different source to that used to develop the model. The aim of this study was to validate the Intensive Care National Audit \& Research Centre ({ICNARC}) model using independently collected data from critical care units in Scotland.

Methods
Data were extracted from the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group ({SICSAG}) database for the years 2007 to 2009. Recoding and mapping of variables was performed, as required, to apply the {ICNARC} model (2009 recalibration) to the {SICSAG} data using standard computer algorithms. The performance of the {ICNARC} model was assessed for discrimination, calibration and overall fit and compared with that of the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation ({APACHE}) {II} model.

Results
There were 29,626 admissions to 24 adult, general critical care units in Scotland between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2009. After exclusions, 23,269 admissions were included in the analysis. The {ICNARC} model outperformed {APACHE} {II} on measures of discrimination (c index 0.848 versus 0.806), calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-squared statistic 18.8 versus 214) and overall fit (Brier’s score 0.140 versus 0.157; Shapiro’s R 0.652 versus 0.621). Model performance was consistent across the three years studied.

Conclusions
The {ICNARC} model performed well when validated in an external population to that in which it was developed, using independently collected data.

	abstract = {Background:Readmission to the Intensive Care Unit ({ICU}) is associated with a high risk of in-hospital mortality and higher health care costs. Previously published tools to predict {ICU} readmission in surgical {ICU} patients have important limitations that restrict their clinical implementation. We sought to develop a clinically intuitive score that can be implemented to predict readmission to the {ICU} after surgery or trauma. We designed the score to emphasize modifiable predictors.Methods:In this retrospective cohort study, we included surgical patients requiring critical care between June 2015 and January 2019 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, {MA}, {USA}. We used logistic regression to fit a prognostic model for {ICU} readmission from a priori defined, widely available candidate predictors. The score performance was compared with existing prediction instruments.Results:Of 7,126 patients, 168 (2.4\%) were readmitted to the {ICU} during the same hospitalization. The final score included 8 variables addressing demographical factors, surgical factors, physiological parameters, {ICU} treatment and the acuity of illness. The maximum score achievable was 13 points. Potentially modifiable predictors included the inability to ambulate at {ICU} discharge, substantial positive fluid balance ({\textgreater}5 liters), severe anemia (hemoglobin {\textless}7 mg/dl), hyperglycemia ({\textgreater}180 mg/dl), and long {ICU} length of stay ({\textgreater}5 days). The score yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78 (95\% {CI} 0.74-0.82) and significantly outperformed previously published scores. The performance of the underlying model was confirmed by leave-one-out cross-validation.Conclusion:The {RISC}-score is a clinically intuitive prediction instrument that helps identify surgical {ICU} patients at high risk for {ICU} readmission. The simplicity of the score facilitates its clinical implementation across surgical divisions.},

Nevertheless, knowledge of epidemiology of {ICU} readmissions, risk factors, and attributable outcomes is restricted to developed countries.Objectives: To determine the effect of {ICU} readmissions on in-hospital mortality, determine incidence of {ICU} readmissions, identify predictors of {ICU} readmissions and hospital mortality, and compare resource use and outcomes between readmitted and nonreadmitted patients in a developing country.Methods: This retrospective single-center cohort study was conducted in a 40-bed, open medical-surgical {ICU} of a private, tertiary care hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. The Local Ethics Committee at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein approved the study protocol, and the need for informed consent was waived. All consecutive adult (≥18 yr) patients admitted to the {ICU} between June 1, 2013 and July 1, 2015 were enrolled in this study.Results: Comparisons were made between patients readmitted and not readmitted to the {ICU}. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of {ICU} readmissions and hospital mortality. Out of 5,779 patients admitted to the {ICU}, 576 (10\%) were readmitted to the {ICU} during the same hospitalization. Compared with nonreadmitted patients, patients readmitted to the {ICU} were more often men (349 of 576 patients [60.6\%] vs. 2,919 of 5,203 patients [56.1\%]; P = 0.042), showed a higher (median [interquartile range]) severity of illness (Simplified Acute Physiology {III} score) at index {ICU} admission (50 [41–61] vs. 42 [32–54], respectively, for readmitted and nonreadmitted patients; P {\textless} 0.001), and were more frequently admitted due to medical reasons (425 of 576 [73.8\%] vs. 2,998 of 5,203 [57.6\%], respectively, for readmitted and nonreadmitted patients; P {\textless} 0.001).

After adjusting for severity of illness, {ICU} readmission ({OR}, 4.103; 95\% {CI}, 3.226–5.518; P {\textless} 0.001), admission source, presence of cancer, use of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy, length of {ICU} stay, and nighttime {ICU} discharge were associated with increased risk of in-hospital death.Conclusions: Readmissions to the {ICU} were frequent and strongly related to poor outcomes.

              Objective
              The growing availability of rich clinical data such as patients’ electronic health records provide great opportunities to address a broad range of real-world questions in medicine. At the same time, artificial intelligence and machine learning ({ML})-based approaches have shown great premise on extracting insights from those data and helping with various clinical problems. The goal of this study is to conduct a systematic comparative study of different {ML} algorithms for several predictive modeling problems in urgent care.
            
            
              Design
              We assess the performance of 4 benchmark prediction tasks (eg mortality and prediction, differential diagnostics, and disease marker discovery) using medical histories, physiological time-series, and demographics data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care ({MIMIC}-{III}) database.
            
            
              Measurements
              For each given task, performance was estimated using standard measures including the area under the receiver operating characteristic ({AUC}) curve, F-1 score, sensitivity, and specificity. Microaveraged {AUC} was used for multiclass classification models.
            
            
              Results and Discussion
              Our results suggest that recurrent neural networks show the most promise in mortality prediction where temporal patterns in physiologic features alone can capture in-hospital mortality risk ({AUC} \&gt; 0.90). Temporal models did not provide additional benefit compared to deep models in differential diagnostics. When comparing the training–testing behaviors of readmission and mortality models, we illustrate that readmission risk may be independent of patient stability at discharge. We also introduce a multiclass prediction scheme for length of stay which preserves sensitivity and {AUC} with outliers of increasing duration despite decrease in sample size.},

	abstract = {Objectives Unplanned readmissions to the intensive care unit ({ICU}) are highly undesirable, increasing variance in care, making resource planning difficult and potentially increasing length of stay and mortality in some settings. Identifying patients who are likely to suffer unplanned {ICU} readmission could reduce the frequency of this adverse event.
Setting A single academic, tertiary care hospital in the {UK}.
Participants A set of 3326 {ICU} episodes collected between October 2014 and August 2016. All records were of patients who visited an {ICU} at some point during their stay. We excluded patients who were ≤16 years of age; visited {ICUs} other than the general and neurosciences {ICU}; were missing crucial electronic patient record measurements; or had indeterminate {ICU} discharge outcomes or very early or extremely late discharge times. After exclusion, 2018 outcome-labelled episodes remained.
Primary and secondary outcome measures Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUROC}) for prediction of unplanned {ICU} readmission or in-hospital death within 48 hours of first {ICU} discharge.
Results In 10-fold cross-validation, an ensemble predictor was trained on data from both the target hospital and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care ({MIMIC}-{III}) database and tested on the target hospital’s data. This predictor discriminated between patients with the unplanned {ICU} readmission or death outcome and those without this outcome, attaining mean {AUROC} of 0.7095 ({SE} 0.0260), superior to the purpose-built Stability and Workload Index for Transfer ({SWIFT}) score ({AUROC}=0.6082, {SE} 0.0249; p=0.014, pairwise t-test).
Conclusions Despite the inherent difficulties, we demonstrate that a novel machine learning algorithm based on transfer learning could achieve good discrimination, over and above that of the treating clinicians or the value added by the {SWIFT} score. Accurate prediction of unplanned readmission could be used to target resources more efficiently.},

	abstract = {The {COVID}-19 pandemic continues to cause critical illness and deaths internationally. Up to 31 May 2020, mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units ({ICU}) with {COVID}-19 was 41.6\%. Since then, changes in therapeutics and management may have improved outcomes. Also, data from countries affected later in the pandemic are now available. We searched {MEDLINE}, Embase, {PubMed} and Cochrane databases up to 30 September 2020 for studies reporting {ICU} mortality among adult patients with {COVID}-19 and present an updated systematic review and meta-analysis. The primary outcome measure was death in intensive care as a proportion of completed {ICU} admissions, either through discharge from intensive care or death. We identified 52 observational studies including 43,128 patients, and first reports from the Middle East, South Asia and Australasia, as well as four national or regional registries. Reported mortality was lower in registries compared with other reports. In two regions, mortality differed significantly from all others, being higher in the Middle East and lower in a single registry study from Australasia. Although {ICU} mortality (95\%{CI}) was lower than reported in June (35.5\% (31.3-39.9\%) vs. 41.6\% (34.0-49.7\%)), the absence of patient-level data prevents a definitive evaluation. A lack of standardisation of reporting prevents comparison of cohorts in terms of underlying risk, severity of illness or outcomes. We found that the decrease in {ICU} mortality from {COVID}-19 has reduced or plateaued since May 2020 and note the possibility of some geographical variation. More standardisation in reporting would improve the ability to compare outcomes from different reports.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The trial objective is to determine if Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ({CPAP}) or High-Flow Nasal Oxygen ({HFNO}) is clinically effective compared to standard oxygen therapy in patients with confirmed or suspected {COVID}-19.
{TRIAL} {DESIGN}: Adaptive (group-sequential), parallel group, pragmatic, superiority randomised controlled, open-label, multi-centre, effectiveness trial.
{PARTICIPANTS}: The trial is being conducted across approximately 60 hospitals across England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Inpatients at participating hospitals are eligible to participate if they have respiratory failure with suspected or proven {COVID}-19, and meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.
{INCLUSION} {CRITERIA}: 1) Adults ≥ 18 years; 2) Admitted to hospital with suspected or proven {COVID}-19; 3) Receiving oxygen with fraction of inspired oxygen ({FiO}2) ≥0.4 and peripheral oxygen saturation ({SpO}2) ≤94\%; and 4) Plan for escalation to tracheal intubation if needed.
{EXCLUSION} {CRITERIA}: 1) Planned tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation imminent within 1 hour; 2) Known or clinically apparent pregnancy; 3) Any absolute contraindication to {CPAP} or {HFNO}; 4) Decision not to intubate due to ceiling of treatment or withdrawal of treatment anticipated; and 5) Equipment for both {CPAP} and {HFNO} not available.
{INTERVENTION} {AND} {COMPARATOR}: Intervention one: Continuous positive airway pressure delivered by any device. Set-up and therapy titration is not protocolised and is delivered in accordance with clinical discretion. Intervention two: High-flow nasal oxygen delivered by any device. Set-up and therapy titration is not protocolised and is delivered in accordance with clinical discretion. Comparator group: Standard care- oxygen delivered by face mask or nasal cannula (excluding the use of continuous positive airway pressure or high-flow nasal oxygen). Set-up and therapy titration is not protocolised and is delivered in accordance with clinical discretion. Intervention delivery continues up to the point of death, tracheal intubation, or clinical determination that there is no ongoing need (palliation or improvement).
{MAIN} {OUTCOMES}: The primary outcome is a composite outcome comprising tracheal intubation or mortality within 30 days following randomisation. Secondary outcomes include tracheal intubation rate, time to tracheal intubation, duration of invasive ventilation, mortality rate, time to mortality, length of hospital stay, and length of critical care stay.
{RANDOMISATION}: Participants are randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either continuous positive airway pressure, high-flow nasal oxygen or standard care. Due to the challenging environment of study delivery, a specific intervention may not always be available at the hospital site. The study uses two integrated randomisation systems to allow, where required, the site to randomise between all three interventions, between {CPAP} and standard care, and between {HFNO} and standard care. System integration ensures maintenance of balance between interventions. Randomisation is performed using a telephone-based interactive voice response system to maintain allocation concealment. The randomisation sequence was computer-generated using the minimisation method. Participant randomisation is stratified by site, gender (M/F), and age ({\textless}50, {\textgreater}=50 years).
{BLINDING} ({MASKING}): The nature of the trial interventions precludes blinding of the researcher, patient and clinical team. Primary and secondary outcomes are all objective outcomes, thereby minimising the risk of detection bias.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To evaluate the role of continuous positive air pressure ({CPAP}) in the management of respiratory failure associated with {COVID}-19 infection. Early clinical management with limited use of {CPAP} (3\% of patients) was compared with a later clinical management strategy which had a higher proportion of {CPAP} use (15\%).
{DESIGN}: Retrospective case-controlled service evaluation for a single {UK} National Health Service ({NHS}) Trust during March-June 2020 designed and conducted solely to estimate the effects of current care.
{SETTING}: The acute inpatient unit in Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh Teaching Hospitals {NHS} Foundation Trust, a medium-sized English {NHS} Trust.
{PARTICIPANTS}: 206 patients with antigen confirmed {COVID}-19 disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome admitted between 17 March 2020 and 3 April 2020 for the early group (controls), and between 10 April 2020 and 11 May 2020 for the late group (cases). Follow-up for all cases was until 11 June by which time all patients had a final outcome of death or discharge. Both groups were composed of 103 patients. Cases and controls were matched by age and sex.
{OUTCOME} {MEASURE}: The outcome measure was the proportion of patients surviving at time t (time from the positive result of {COVID}-19 test to discharge/death date). The predictors were {CPAP} intervention, intubation, residence in care homes and comorbidities (renal, pulmonary, cardiac, hypertension and diabetes). A stratified Cox proportional hazard for clustered data (via generalised estimating equations) and model selection algorithms were employed to identify the effect of {CPAP} on patients' survival and the effect on gas exchange as measured by alveolar arterial (A-a) gradient and timing of {CPAP} treatment on {CPAP} patients' survival.
{RESULTS}: {CPAP} was found to be significantly ({HR} 0.38, 95\% {CI} 0.36 to 0.40) associated with lower risk of death in patients with hospital stay equal to, or below 7 days. However, for longer hospitalisation {CPAP} was found to be associated with increased risk of death ({HR} 1.72, 95\% {CI} 1.40 to 2.12). When {CPAP} was initiated within 4 days of hospital admission, the survival probability was above 73\% (95\% {CI} 53\% to 99\%). In addition, lower A-a gradient was associated with lower risk of death in {CPAP} patients ({HR} 1.011, 95\% {CI} 1.010 to 1.013). The selected model (best fit) was stratified by sex and clustered by case/control groups. The predictors were age, intubation, hypertension and the residency from care homes, which were found to be statistically significantly associated with patient's death/discharge.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {CPAP} is a simple and cost-effective intervention. It has been established for care of other respiratory disorders but not for {COVID}-19 respiratory failure. This evaluation establishes that {CPAP} as a potentially viable treatment option for this group of patients during the first days of hospital admission. As yet there is limited availability of quantitative research on {CPAP} use for {COVID}-19. Whist this work is hampered by both the relatively small sample size and retrospective design (which reduced the ability to control potential confounders), it represents evidence of the significant benefit of early {CPAP} intervention. This evaluation should stimulate further research questions and larger study designs on the potential benefit of {CPAP} for {COVID}-19 infections. Globally, this potentially beneficial low cost and low intensity therapy could have added significance economically for healthcare provision in less developed countries.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Continuous positive airway pressure ({CPAP}) ventilation may be used as a potential bridge to invasive mechanical ventilation ({IMV}), or as a ceiling-of-care for persistent hypoxaemia despite standard oxygen therapy, according to {UK} guidelines. We examined the association of mode of respiratory support and ceiling-of-care on mortality.
{METHODS}: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of routinely collected de-identified data of adults with nasal/throat {SARs}-{CoV}-2 swab-positive results, at the Calderdale and Huddersfield {NHS} Foundation Trust between 10th March-19th April 2020 (outcomes determined on 22nd May).
{FINDINGS}: Of 347 patients with {SARs}-{CoV}-2 swab-positive results, 294 (84.7\%) patients admitted for Covid-19 were included in the study. Sixty-nine patients were trialled on {CPAP}, mostly delivered by face mask, either as an early ceiling of care instituted within 24 hours of admission (N = 19), or as a potential bridge to {IMV} (N = 44). Patients receiving a ceiling of care more than 24 hours after admission (N = 6) were excluded from the analysis. Two hundred and fifteen patients (73.1\%) maximally received air/standard oxygen therapy, and 45 (15.3\%) patients maximally received {CPAP}. Thirty-four patients (11.6\%) required {IMV}, of which 24 had received prior {CPAP}. There were 138 patients with an early ceiling-of-care plan (pre-admission/within 24h). Overall, 103(35.0\%) patients died and 191(65.0\%) were alive at study end. Among all patients trialled on {CPAP} either as a potential bridge to {IMV} (N = 44) or as a ceiling-of-care (N = 19) mortality was 25\% and 84\%, respectively. Overall, there was strong evidence for higher mortality among patients who required {CPAP} or {IMV}, compared to those who required only air/oxygen ({aOR} 5.24 95\%{CI}: 1.38, 19.81 and {aOR} 46.47 95\%{CI}: 7.52, 287.08, respectively; p{\textless}0.001), and among patients with early ceiling-of-care compared to those without a ceiling ({aOR} 41.81 95\%{CI}: 8.28, 211.17; p{\textless}0.001). Among patients without a ceiling of care (N = 137), 10 patients required prompt intubation following failed oxygen therapy, but 44 patients received {CPAP}. {CPAP} failure, defined as death (N = 1) or intubation (N = 24), occurred in 57\% (N = 25) of patients. But in total, 75\% (N = 33) of those started on {CPAP} with no ceiling of care recovered to discharge-19 without the need for {IMV}, and 14 following {IMV}.
{CONCLUSION}: Our data suggest that among patients with no ceiling-of-care, an initial trial of {CPAP} as a potential bridge to {IMV} offers a favourable therapeutic alternative to early intubation. In contrast, among patients with a ceiling-of care, {CPAP} seems to offer little additional survival benefit beyond oxygen therapy alone. Information on ceilings of respiratory support is vital to interpreting mortality from Covid-19.

	abstract = {{BackgroundPatients} with atrial fibrillation ({AF}) treated with oral anticoagulants may be exposed to an increased risk of bleeding events. The {HAS}‐{BLED} (Hypertension, Abnormal renal and liver function, Stroke, Bleeding, Labile {INRs}, Elderly, Drugs or alcohol) score is a simple, well‐established, clinical bleeding‐risk prediction score. Recently, a new algorithm‐based score was proposed, the {GARFIELD}‐{AF} (Global Anticoagulant in the Field–{AF}) bleeding score. We compared {HAS}‐{BLED} and {GARFIELD}‐{AF} scores in predicting adjudicated bleeding events in a clinical trial cohort of patients with {AF} taking anticoagulants, in the first external comparative validation of both scores.Methods and {ResultsWe} analyzed patients from the {SPORTIF} (Stroke Prevention Using an Oral Thrombin Inhibitor in Patients With {AF}) {III} and V trials. All patients assigned to the warfarin arm with information to calculate the scores were considered. Outcomes were major, major/clinically relevant nonmajor, and any bleeding. A total of 3550 warfarin‐treated patients were available for analysis. Of these patients, 2519 (71.0\%) had a {HAS}‐{BLED} score ≥3, whereas based on {GARFIELD}‐{AF} median value, 2056 (57.9\%) were categorized as “high score.” Both {HAS}‐{BLED} and {GARFIELD}‐{AF} C‐indexes showed modest predictive value (C‐index [95\% confidence interval] for major bleeding, 0.58 [0.56–0.60] and 0.56 [0.54–0.57], respectively); however, {GARFIELD}‐{AF} was not predictive of any bleeding. The {GARFIELD}‐{AF} bleeding score had a significantly lower sensitivity and a negative reclassification for any bleeding compared with {HAS}‐{BLED}, assessed by integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification improvement (both P{\textless}0.001). {HAS}‐{BLED} showed a 5\% net benefit for any bleeding occurrence.{ConclusionsThe} algorithm‐based {GARFIELD}‐{AF} bleeding score did not show any significant improvement in major and major/clinically relevant nonmajor prediction compared with the simple {HAS}‐{BLED} score. For clinical usefulness in prediction of any bleeding, the {HAS}‐{BLED} score showed a significant net benefit compared with the {GARFIELD}‐{AF}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is the most common sustained heart arrhythmia. However, as many cases are asymptomatic, a large proportion of patients remain undiagnosed until serious complications arise. Efficient, cost-effective detection of the undiagnosed may be supported by risk-prediction models relating patient factors to {AF} risk. However, there exists a need for an implementable risk model that is contemporaneous and informed by routinely collected patient data, reflecting the real-world pathology of {AF}.
{METHODS}: This study sought to develop and evaluate novel and conventional statistical and machine learning models for risk-predication of {AF}. This was a retrospective, cohort study of adults (aged ≥30 years) without a history of {AF}, listed on the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, from January 2006 to December 2016. Models evaluated included published risk models (Framingham, {ARIC}, {CHARGE}-{AF}), machine learning models, which evaluated baseline and time-updated information (neural network, {LASSO}, random forests, support vector machines), and Cox regression.
{RESULTS}: Analysis of 2,994,837 individuals (3.2\% {AF}) identified time-varying neural networks as the optimal model achieving an {AUROC} of 0.827 vs. 0.725, with number needed to screen of 9 vs. 13 patients at 75\% sensitivity, when compared with the best existing model {CHARGE}-{AF}. The optimal model confirmed known baseline risk factors (age, previous cardiovascular disease, antihypertensive medication usage) and identified additional time-varying predictors (proximity of cardiovascular events, body mass index (both levels and changes), pulse pressure, and the frequency of blood pressure measurements).
{CONCLUSION}: The optimal time-varying machine learning model exhibited greater predictive performance than existing {AF} risk models and reflected known and new patient risk factors for {AF}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is thought to be a relatively common arrhythmia in the setting of noncardiac intensive care unit ({ICU}). However, data concerning {AF} deriving from such populations are scarce. In addition, it is unclear which of the wide spectrum of {AF} predictors are relevant to the {ICU} setting.
{OBJECTIVES}: The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence of new-onset {AF} and investigate the factors that contribute to its occurrence in {ICU} patients.
{METHODS}: We prospectively studied all patients admitted to our {ICU} during a 1-year period. Patients admitted for brief postoperative monitoring and patients with chronic or intermittent {AF} and {AF} present upon admission were excluded. A number of conditions incriminated as {AF} risk factors or "triggers" from demographics, medical history, present disease, and cardiac echocardiography as well as circumstances of {AF} onset were recorded.
{RESULTS}: The study population consisted of 133 patients (90 males). Atrial fibrillation was observed in 15\% of them. Age older than 65 years (P=.001), arterial hypertension (P=.03), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (P{\textless}.001), sepsis (P=.001), left atrial dilatation (P=.01), and diastolic dysfunction (P=.04) were significantly associated with the occurrence of {AF}. By multivariate analysis, it was demonstrated that only older than 65 years (odds ratio, 7.0; 95\% confidence interval, 2.0-24.6; P=.003) and sepsis (odds ratio, 6.5; 95\% confidence interval, 2.0-21.1; P=.002) independently predict new-onset {AF}. Patients manifesting {AF} were frequently hypovolemic (30\%) and had electrolyte disorders (40\%) as well as elevated and rising serum C-reactive protein (70\%).
{CONCLUSION}: A significant fraction of {ICU} patients manifest {AF}. The predictors of interest for the {ICU} patients might be considerably different than those of the general population and other subgroups with systemic inflammation possibly having a pivotal role.},

Objectives: We aimed to evaluate whether indices of oxygen desaturation and {PRV} derived from nocturnal oximetry were associated with {AF} incidence in patients investigated for {OSA}. Methods: Data from a large multicenter cohort of {AF}-free patients investigated for {OSA} between May 15, 2007, and December 31, 2017, were linked to health administrative data to identify hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients with new-onset {AF}.

Results: After a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 5.34 (3.3–8.0) years, 181 of 7,205 patients developed {AF} (130 were hospitalized for {AF}). After adjusting for confounders, including anthropomorphic data, alcohol intake, cardiac, metabolic and respiratory diseases, β blocker/calcium channel blocker medications, type of sleep study, study site, and positive airway pressure adherence, {AF} risk was associated with increasing nocturnal hypoxemia (P trend = 0.004 for quartiles of percentage of recording time with oxygen saturation {\textless}90\%) and {PRV} (P trend {\textless} 0.0001 for quartiles of root mean square of the successive normal-normal beat interval differences), and decreasing sympathetic/parasympathetic tone (P trend = 0.0006 for quartiles of low-frequency power/high-frequency power ratio).

The {RR} is the ratio of the probability of an outcome in an intervention group to its probability in a control group. Thus, the {RR} provides a measure of change in the likelihood of an event linked to a given intervention. This measure has been widely used because it is today considered a measure with "portability" across varying outcome prevalence, especially when the outcome is rare. It turns out, however, that there is a much more important problem with this ratio, and this paper aims to demonstrate this problem.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We used mathematical derivation to determine if the {RR} is a measure of effect magnitude alone (i.e., a larger absolute value always indicating a stronger effect) or not. We also used the same derivation to determine its relationship to the prevalence of an outcome. We confirm the derivation results with a follow-up analysis of 140,620 trials scraped from the Cochrane.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We demonstrate that the {RR} varies for reasons other than the magnitude of the effect because it is a ratio of two posterior probabilities, both of which are dependent on baseline prevalence of an outcome. In addition, we demonstrate that the {RR} shifts toward its null value with increasing outcome prevalence. The shift toward the null happens regardless of the strength of the association between intervention and outcome. The odds ratio ({OR}), the other commonly used ratio, measures solely the effect magnitude and has no relationship to the prevalence of an outcome in a study nor does it overestimate the {RR} as is commonly thought.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The results demonstrate the need to (1) end the primary use of the {RR} in clinical trials and meta-analyses as its direct interpretation is not meaningful, (2) replace the {RR} by the {OR}, and (3) only use the postintervention risk recalculated from the {OR} for any expected level of baseline risk in absolute terms for purposes of interpretation such as the number needed to treat. These results will have far-reaching implications such as reducing misleading results from clinical trials and meta-analyses and ushering in a new era in the reporting of such trials or meta-analyses in practice.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Introduction. During previous viral pandemics, reported co-infection rates and implicated pathogens have varied. In the 1918 influenza pandemic, a large proportion of severe illness and death was complicated by bacterial co-infection, predominantly Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus . Gap statement. A better understanding of the incidence of co-infection in patients with {COVID}-19 infection and the pathogens involved is necessary for effective antimicrobial stewardship. Aim. To describe the incidence and nature of co-infection in critically ill adults with {COVID}-19 infection in England. Methodology. A retrospective cohort study of adults with {COVID}-19 admitted to seven intensive care units ({ICUs}) in England up to 18 May 2020, was performed. Patients with completed {ICU} stays were included. The proportion and type of organisms were determined at \&lt;48 and \&gt;48 h following hospital admission, corresponding to community and hospital-acquired co-infections. Results. Of 254 patients studied (median age 59 years ({IQR} 49–69); 64.6 \% male), 139 clinically significant organisms were identified from 83 (32.7 \%) patients. Bacterial co-infections/ co-colonisation were identified within 48 h of admission in 14 (5.5 \%) patients; the commonest pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (four patients) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (two patients). The proportion of pathogens detected increased with duration of {ICU} stay, consisting largely of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli . The co-infection/ co-colonisation rate \&gt;48 h after admission was 27/1000 person-days (95 \% {CI} 21.3–34.1). Patients with co-infections/ co-colonisation were more likely to die in {ICU} (crude {OR} 1.78,95 \% {CI} 1.03–3.08, P=0.04) compared to those without co-infections/ co-colonisation. Conclusion. We found limited evidence for community-acquired bacterial co-infection in hospitalised adults with {COVID}-19, but a high rate of Gram-negative infection acquired during {ICU} stay.,},

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) has caused a global pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19). However, the microbial composition of the respiratory tract and other infected tissues as well as their possible pathogenic contributions to varying degrees of disease severity in {COVID}-19 patients remain unclear. Between 27 January and 26 February 2020, serial clinical specimens (sputum, nasal and throat swab, anal swab and feces) were collected from a cohort of hospitalized {COVID}-19 patients, including 8 mildly and 15 severely ill patients in Guangdong province, China. Total {RNA} was extracted and ultra-deep metatranscriptomic sequencing was performed in combination with laboratory diagnostic assays. We identified distinct signatures of microbial dysbiosis among severely ill {COVID}-19 patients on broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy. Co-detection of other human respiratory viruses (including human alphaherpesvirus 1, rhinovirus B, and human orthopneumovirus) was demonstrated in 30.8\% (4/13) of the severely ill patients, but not in any of the mildly affected patients. Notably, the predominant respiratory microbial taxa of severely ill patients were Burkholderia cepacia complex ({BCC}), Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Mycoplasma spp. (including M. hominis and M. orale). The presence of the former two bacterial taxa was also confirmed by clinical cultures of respiratory specimens (expectorated sputum or nasal secretions) in 23.1\% (3/13) of the severe cases. Finally, a time-dependent, secondary infection of B. cenocepacia with expressions of multiple virulence genes was demonstrated in one severely ill patient, which might accelerate his disease deterioration and death occurring one month after {ICU} admission. Our findings point to {SARS}-{CoV}-2-related microbial dysbiosis and various antibiotic-resistant respiratory microbes/pathogens in hospitalized {COVID}-19 patients in relation to disease severity. Detection and tracking strategies are needed to prevent the spread of antimicrobial resistance, improve the treatment regimen and clinical outcomes of hospitalized, severely ill {COVID}-19 patients.},

The objective of this study was to assess the characteristics and ouctome of {ICU}-acquired infections in {COVID}-19 patients. We conducted a retrospective single-centre, case-control study including 140 patients with severe {COVID}-19 admitted to the {ICU} between March and May 2020. We evaluated the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological features, and outcome of {ICU}-acquired infections. Fifty-seven patients (40.7\%) developed a bacterial or fungal nosocomial infection during {ICU} stay. Infection occurred after a median of 9 days ({IQR} 5-11) of admission and was significantly associated with the {APACHE} {II} score (p = 0.02). There were 91 episodes of infection: primary (31\%) and catheter-related (25\%) bloodstream infections were the most frequent, followed by pneumonia (23\%), tracheobronchitis (10\%), and urinary tract infection (8\%) that were produced by a wide spectrum of Gram-positive (55\%) and Gram-negative bacteria (30\%) as well as fungi (15\%). In 60\% of cases, infection was associated with septic shock and a significant increase in {SOFA} score. Overall {ICU} mortality was 36\% (51/140). Infection was significantly associated with death ({OR} 2.7, 95\% {CI} 1.2-5.9, p = 0.015) and a longer {ICU} stay (p {\textless} 0.001). Bacterial and fungal nosocomial infection is a common complication of {ICU} admission in patients with {COVID}-19. It usually presents as a severe form of infection, and it is associated with a high mortality and longer course of {ICU} stay.},

	abstract = {The performance of prediction models can be assessed using a variety of different methods and metrics. Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration., Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement ({NRI}), and integrated discrimination improvement ({IDI}). Moreover, decision–analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions., We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n=544 for model development, n=273 for external validation)., We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for making clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.},

	abstract = {Objective To develop a predictive model for real-time predictions of length of stay, mortality, and readmission for hospitalized patients using electronic health records ({EHRs}).Materials and Methods A Bayesian Network model was built to estimate the probability of a hospitalized patient being “at home,” in the hospital, or dead for each of the next 7 days. The network utilizes patient-specific administrative and laboratory data and is updated each time a new pathology test result becomes available. Electronic health records from 32 634 patients admitted to a Sydney metropolitan hospital via the emergency department from July 2008 through December 2011 were used. The model was tested on 2011 data and trained on the data of earlier years.Results The model achieved an average daily accuracy of 80\% and area under the receiving operating characteristic curve ({AUROC}) of 0.82. The model’s predictive ability was highest within 24 hours from prediction ({AUROC} = 0.83) and decreased slightly with time. Death was the most predictable outcome with a daily average accuracy of 93\% and {AUROC} of 0.84.Discussion We developed the first non–disease-specific model that simultaneously predicts remaining days of hospitalization, death, and readmission as part of the same outcome. By providing a future daily probability for each outcome class, we enable the visualization of future patient trajectories. Among these, it is possible to identify trajectories indicating expected discharge, expected continuing hospitalization, expected death, and possible readmission.Conclusions Bayesian Networks can model {EHRs} to provide real-time forecasts for patient outcomes, which provide richer information than traditional independent point predictions of length of stay, death, or readmission, and can thus better support decision making.},

Many risk factors for {NOAF} during critical illness have been identified, overlapping with risk factors for atrial fibrillation in patients in community settings.

These have not been studied in detail and it is not clear which variables warrant further study.{MethodsWe} undertook an international three-round Delphi process using an expert panel to identify important predictors of {NOAF} risk during critical illness.{ResultsOf} 22 experts invited, 12 agreed to participate.

These results support further research into modifiable risk factors including optimal plasma electrolyte concentrations, rates of change of these electrolytes, fluid balance, choice of vasoactive medications and the use of preventative medications in high-risk patients.

In a clinical setting, the baseline autonomic function can reflect ability to adapt to stressors such as anesthesia. No monitoring tool has yet been developed that is able to track changes in {HRV} in real time. This study is a proof-of-concept for a non-invasive, real-time monitoring model for autonomic function via continuous Poincaré quantification of {HRV} dynamics. Anonymized heart rate data of 18 healthy individuals (18–45 years) undergoing minor procedures and 18 healthy controls (21–35 years) were analyzed. Patients underwent propofol and fentanyl anesthesia, and controls were at rest. Continuous heart rate monitoring was carried out from before aesthetic induction to the end of the surgical procedure. {HRV} components (sympathetic and parasympathetic) were extracted and analyzed using Poincaré quantification, and a real-time assessment tool was developed. In the patient group, a significant decrease in the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of {HRV} was observed following anesthesia ({SD}1: p = 0.019; {SD}2: p = 0.00027). No corresponding change in {HRV} was observed in controls. {HRV} parameters were modelled into a real-time graph. Using the monitoring technique developed, autonomic changes could be successfully visualized in real-time. This could provide the basis for a novel, fast and non-invasive method of autonomic assessment that can be delivered at the point of care.},

Adults with obstructive sleep apnoea ({OSA}) display substantial heart rate changes during sleep, associated with obstructive respiratory events 1, 2. These heart rate changes are significantly attenuated or abolished with effective continuous positive airway pressure ({CPAP}) treatment 3.

Heart rate variability ({HRV}) refers to the regulation of the sinoatrial node by the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. Evaluation of autonomic heart rate control by means of {HRV} measures has been widely accepted as an important source of information on cardiovascular function 4, 5. {HRV} is important because it provides a window to observe the heart's ability to respond to normal or abnormal regulatory impulses that affect its rate and rhythm.

Several sophisticated methodologies were developed for measuring {HRV}, notably those using the heart rate power spectrum and nonlinear dynamics analysis 6. However, based on the literature, no simple methodology is available for comprehensive use in daily medical practice.

However, a Poincaré or Lorenz plot is a simple semi-quantitative method for visualising and calculating {HRV} 7–10. It has been previously shown that the length and width of a Poincaré plot are a weighted combination of low- and high-frequency powers, so it provides a theoretical link between …},

	abstract = {The Poincaré plot is a popular two-dimensional, time series analysis tool because of its intuitive display of dynamic system behavior. Poincaré plots have been used to visualize heart rate and respiratory pattern variabilities. However, conventional quantitative analysis relies primarily on statistical measurements of the cumulative distribution of points, making it difficult to interpret irregular or complex plots. Moreover, the plots are constructed to reflect highly correlated regions of the time series, reducing the amount of nonlinear information that is presented and thereby hiding potentially relevant features. We propose temporal Poincaré variability ({TPV}), a novel analysis methodology that uses standard techniques to quantify the temporal distribution of points and to detect nonlinear sources responsible for physiological variability. In addition, the analysis is applied across multiple time delays, yielding a richer insight into system dynamics than the traditional circle return plot. The method is applied to data sets of R-R intervals and to synthetic point process data extracted from the Lorenz time series. The results demonstrate that {TPV} complements the traditional analysis and can be applied more generally, including Poincaré plots with multiple clusters, and more consistently than the conventional measures and can address questions regarding potential structure underlying the variability of a data set.},

	abstract = {The Poincaré plot is a geometrical technique used to visualise and quantify the correlation between two consecutive data points in a time-series. Since the dynamics of fluctuations in physiological rhythms exhibit long-term correlation and memory, this study aimed to extend the Poincaré plot by calculating the correlation between sequential data points in a time-series, rather than between two consecutive points. By incorporating this so-called lag, we hope to integrate a temporal aspect into quantifying the correlation, to depict whether a physiological system holds prolonged association between events separated by time. In doing so, it attempts to instantaneously characterise the intrinsic behaviour of a complex system. We tested this hypothesis on three different physiological time-series: heart rate variability in patients with liver cirrhosis, respiratory rhythm in asthma and body temperature fluctuation in patients with cirrhosis, to evaluate the potential application of the extended Poincaré method in clinical practice. When studying the cardiac inter-beat intervals, the extended Poincaré plot revealed a stronger autocorrelation for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis compared to less severe cases using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. In addition, long-term variability (known as {SD}2 in the extended Poincaré plot) appeared as an independent prognostic variable. This holds significance by acting as a non-invasive tool to evaluate patients with chronic liver disease and potentially facilitate transplant selection as an adjuvant to traditional criteria. For asthmatics, employing the extended Poincaré plot allowed for a non-invasive tool to differentially diagnose various classifications of respiratory disease. In the respiratory inter-breath interval analysis, the receiver operating characteristic curve ({ROC}) provided evidence that the extension of the Poincaré plot holds a greater advantage in the classification of asthmatic patients, over the traditional Poincaré plot. Lastly, the analysis of body temperature from patients using the extended Poincaré plot helped identify inpatients from outpatients with cirrhosis. Through these analyses, the extended Poincaré plot provided unique and additional information which could potentially make a difference in clinical practice. Conclusively, the potential use of our work lies in its possible application of predicting mortality for the organ allocation procedure in patients with cirrhosis and non-invasively distinguish between atopic and non-atopic asthma.},

	abstract = {Introduction Automated systems for ventilator management to date have been either fully heuristic rule-based systems or based on a combination of simple physiological models and rules. These have been shown to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in simple to wean patients. At present, there are no published studies that evaluate the effect of systems that use detailed physiological descriptions of the individual patient.The {BEACON} Caresystem is a model-based decision support system that uses mathematical models of patients’ physiology in combination with models of clinical preferences to provide advice on appropriate ventilator settings. An individual physiological description may be particularly advantageous in selecting the appropriate therapy for a complex, heterogeneous, intensive care unit ({ICU}) patient population.
Methods and analysis Intenive Care weaning ({iCareWean}) is a single-blinded, multicentre, prospective randomised control trial evaluating management of mechanical ventilation as directed by the {BEACON} Caresystem compared with that of current care, in the general intensive care setting. The trial will enrol 274 participants across multiple London National Health Service {ICUs}. The trial will use a primary outcome of duration of mechanical ventilation until successful extubation.

	abstract = {Objective To establish whether there is any change in mortality from infection with a new variant of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, designated a variant of concern ({VOC}-202012/1) in December 2020, compared with circulating {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants.
Design Matched cohort study.
Setting Community based (pillar 2) covid-19 testing centres in the {UK} using the {TaqPath} assay (a proxy measure of {VOC}-202012/1 infection).
Participants 54 906 matched pairs of participants who tested positive for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in pillar 2 between 1 October 2020 and 29 January 2021, followed-up until 12 February 2021. Participants were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, lower tier local authority region, and sample date of positive specimens, and differed only by detectability of the spike protein gene using the {TaqPath} assay.
Main outcome measure Death within 28 days of the first positive {SARS}-{CoV}-2 test result.
Results The mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with {VOC}-202012/1 compared with infection with previously circulating variants was 1.64 (95\% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.04) in patients who tested positive for covid-19 in the community. In this comparatively low risk group, this represents an increase in deaths from 2.5 to 4.1 per 1000 detected cases.
Conclusions The probability that the risk of mortality is increased by infection with {VOC}-202012/01 is high. If this finding is generalisable to other populations, infection with {VOC}-202012/1 has the potential to cause substantial additional mortality compared with previously circulating variants. Healthcare capacity planning and national and international control policies are all impacted by this finding, with increased mortality lending weight to the argument that further coordinated and stringent measures are justified to reduce deaths from {SARS}-{CoV}-2.},

	abstract = {Probabilities can be consistently estimated using random forests. It is, however, unclear how random forests should be updated to make predictions for other centers or at different time points. In this work, we present two approaches for updating random forests for probability estimation. The first method has been proposed by Elkan and may be used for updating any machine learning approach yielding consistent probabilities, so‐called probability machines. The second approach is a new strategy specifically developed for random forests. Using the terminal nodes, which represent conditional probabilities, the random forest is first translated to logistic regression models. These are, in turn, used for re‐calibration. The two updating strategies were compared in a simulation study and are illustrated with data from the German Stroke Study Collaboration. In most simulation scenarios, both methods led to similar improvements. In the simulation scenario in which the stricter assumptions of Elkan's method were not met, the logistic regression‐based re‐calibration approach for random forests outperformed Elkan's method. It also performed better on the stroke data than Elkan's method. The strength of Elkan's method is its general applicability to any probability machine. However, if the strict assumptions underlying this approach are not met, the logistic regression‐based approach is preferable for updating random forests for probability estimation. © 2016 The Authors.

	shorttitle = {Cardiac Output Response to Norepinephrine in Postoperative Cardiac Surgery Patients},
	abstract = {Objective: 
        We studied the variable effects of norepinephrine infusion on cardiac output in postoperative cardiac surgical patients in whom norepinephrine increased mean arterial pressure. We hypothesized that the directional change in cardiac output would be determined by baseline cardiac function, as quantified by stroke volume variation, and the subsequent changes in mean systemic filling pressure and vasomotor tone.
        Design: 
        Intervention study.
        Setting: 
        {ICU} of a university hospital.
        Patients: 
        Sixteen mechanically ventilated postoperative cardiac surgery patients.
        Interventions: 
        Inspiratory holds were performed at baseline-1, during increased norepinephrine infusion, and baseline-2 conditions.
        Measurements and Main Results: 
        We measured mean arterial pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume variation and, with use of inspiratory hold maneuvers, mean systemic filling pressure, then calculated resistance for venous return and systemic vascular resistance. Increasing norepinephrine by 0.04 ± 0.02 μg·kg-1·min-1 increased mean arterial pressure 20 mm Hg in all patients. Cardiac output decreased in ten and increased in six patients. In all patients mean systemic filling pressure, systemic vascular resistance and resistance for venous return increased and stroke volume variation decreased. Resistance for venous return and systemic vascular resistance increased more (p = 0.019 and p = 0.002) in the patients with a cardiac output decrease. Heart rate decreased in the patients with a cardiac output decrease (p = 0.002) and was unchanged in the patients with a cardiac output increase. Baseline stroke volume variation was higher in those in whom cardiac output increased (14.4 ± 4.2\% vs. 9.1 ± 2.4\%, p = 0.012). Stroke volume variation {\textgreater}8.7\% predicted the increase in cardiac output to norepinephrine (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.900).
        Conclusions: 
        The change in cardiac output induced by norepinephrine is determined by the balance of volume recruitment (increase in mean systemic filling pressure), change in resistance for venous return, and baseline heart function. Furthermore, the response of cardiac output on norepinephrine can be predicted by baseline stroke volume variation.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Two distinct subphenotypes have been identified in acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}), but the presence of subgroups in {ARDS} associated with coronavirus disease ({COVID}-19) is unknown. Objectives: To identify clinically relevant, novel subgroups in {COVID}-19-related {ARDS} and compare them with previously described {ARDS} subphenotypes. Methods: Eligible participants were adults with {COVID}-19 and {ARDS} at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Latent class analysis was used to identify subgroups with baseline clinical, respiratory, and laboratory data serving as partitioning variables. A previously developed machine learning model was used to classify patients as the hypoinflammatory and hyperinflammatory subphenotypes. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between subgroups. Heterogeneity of treatment effect for corticosteroid use in subgroups was tested. Measurements and Main Results: From March 2, 2020, to April 30, 2020, 483 patients with {COVID}-19-related {ARDS} met study criteria. A two-class latent class analysis model best fit the population (P = 0.0075). Class 2 (23\%) had higher proinflammatory markers, troponin, creatinine, and lactate, lower bicarbonate, and lower blood pressure than class 1 (77\%). Ninety-day mortality was higher in class 2 versus class 1 (75\% vs. 48\%; P {\textless} 0.0001). Considerable overlap was observed between these subgroups and {ARDS} subphenotypes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) {RT}-{PCR} cycle threshold was associated with mortality in the hypoinflammatory but not the hyperinflammatory phenotype. Heterogeneity of treatment effect to corticosteroids was observed (P = 0.0295), with improved mortality in the hyperinflammatory phenotype and worse mortality in the hypoinflammatory phenotype, with the caveat that corticosteroid treatment was not randomized. Conclusions: We identified two {COVID}-19-related {ARDS} subgroups with differential outcomes, similar to previously described {ARDS} subphenotypes. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {PCR} cycle threshold had differential value for predicting mortality in the subphenotypes. The subphenotypes had differential treatment responses to corticosteroids.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Using latent class analysis ({LCA}) in five randomised controlled trial ({RCT}) cohorts, two distinct phenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) have been identified: hypoinflammatory and hyperinflammatory. The phenotypes are associated with differential outcomes and treatment response. The objective of this study was to develop parsimonious models for phenotype identification that could be accurate and feasible to use in the clinical setting.
{METHODS}: In this retrospective study, three {RCT} cohorts from the National Lung, Heart, and Blood Institute {ARDS} Network ({ARMA}, {ALVEOLI}, and {FACTT}) were used as the derivation dataset (n=2022), from which the machine learning and logistic regression classifer models were derived, and a fourth ({SAILS}; n=715) from the same network was used as the validation test set. {LCA}-derived phenotypes in all of these cohorts served as the reference standard. Machine-learning algorithms (random forest, bootstrapped aggregating, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) were used to select a maximum of six important classifier variables, which were then used to develop nested logistic regression models. Only cases with complete biomarker data in the derivation dataset were used for variable selection. The best logistic regression models based on parsimony and predictive accuracy were then evaluated in the validation test set. Finally, the models' prognostic validity was tested in two external {ARDS} clinical trial datasets ({START} and {HARP}-2) by assessing mortality at days 28, 60, and 90 and ventilator-free days to day 28.
{FINDINGS}: The six most important classifier variables were interleukin ({IL})-8, {IL}-6, protein C, soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1, bicarbonate, and vasopressor use. From the nested models, three-variable ({IL}-8, bicarbonate, and protein C) and four-variable (3-variable plus vasopressor use) models were adjudicated to be the best performing. In the validation test set, both models showed good accuracy ({AUC} 0·94 [95\% {CI} 0·92-0·95] for the three-variable model and 0·95 [95\% {CI} 0·93-0·96] for the four-variable model) against {LCA} classifications. As with {LCA}-derived phenotypes, the hyperinflammatory phenotype as identified by the classifier model was associated with higher mortality at day 90 (87 [39\%] of 223 patients vs 112 [23\%] of 492 patients; p{\textless}0·0001) and fewer ventilator-free days (median 14 days [{IQR} 0-22] vs 22 days [0-25]; p{\textless}0·0001). In the external validation datasets, three-variable models developed in the derivation dataset identified two phenotypes with distinct clinical features and outcomes consistent with previous findings, including differential survival with simvastatin versus placebo in {HARP}-2 (p=0·023 for survival at 28 days).
{INTERPRETATION}: {ARDS} phenotypes can be accurately identified with parsimonious classifier models using three or four variables. Pending the development of real-time testing for key biomarkers and prospective validation, these models could facilitate identification of {ARDS} phenotypes to enable their application in clinical trials and practice.

	abstract = {Background Mortality in acute respiratory failure remains high despite the use of lung-protective ventilation. Recent studies have shown an association between baseline ventilation parameters (driving pressure or mechanical power) and outcomes for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Strategies focused on limiting these parameters have been proposed to further improve outcomes. However, it remains unknown whether driving pressure and mechanical power should be limited over the entire duration of mechanical ventilation and in all patients with acute respiratory failure. We aimed to estimate the association between exposure to different intensities of mechanical ventilation over time and intensive care unit ({ICU}) mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure.
{METHODS}: In this registry-based, prospective cohort study, we obtained data from the Toronto Intensive Care Observational Registry, which includes all patients receiving mechanical ventilation for 4 h or more in nine {ICUs} that are affiliated with the University of Toronto (Toronto, {ON}, Canada). We included all adult (≥18 years) patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation between April 11, 2014, and June 5, 2019. Patients were excluded if they received treatment with extracorporeal life support. The primary outcome was {ICU} mortality. Bayesian joint models were used to estimate the strength of associations, accounting for informative censoring due to death during follow-up.
{FINDINGS}: Of 13 939 patients recorded in the registry, 13 408 (96·2\%) were eligible for descriptive analysis. The primary analysis comprised 7876 (58·7\%) patients with complete baseline characteristics, and a secondary analysis included all 13 408 patients after multiple imputation in the joint model analysis. 2409 (18·0\%) of 13 408 patients died in the {ICU}. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, including age and severity of illness, a significant increase in the hazard of death was found to be associated with each daily increment in driving pressure (hazard ratio 1·064, 95\% credible interval 1·057-1·071) or mechanical power (hazard ratio 1·060, 95\% credible interval 1·053-1·066). These associations persisted over the duration of mechanical ventilation.
{INTERPRETATION}: Cumulative exposure to higher intensities of mechanical ventilation was harmful, even for short durations. Limiting exposure to driving pressure or mechanical power should be evaluated in further studies as promising ventilation strategies to reduce mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure.

{RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Numerous ventilator-associated complications ({VACs}), including {VAP} and {VAT}, may occur in critically ill, intubated patients. A variety of definitions for identifying {VAP} have been proposed, but there is no diagnostic gold standard. The proposed surveillance definition will identify infectious and noninfectious {VAC}, including {VAP} and {VAT}, but this definition may be inadequate for clinical practice.
{SUMMARY}: The clinical characteristics of {VAP} and {VAT} are similar and include fever, leukocytosis, and purulent sputum. An infiltrate on chest radiograph is consistent with {VAP} but lacks diagnostic precision, so it is not a criterion in the proposed surveillance definition and should be interpreted cautiously by clinicians. Microbiologically, quantitative and semiquantitative endotracheal aspirate cultures may be employed to diagnose {VAP} and {VAT}. Positive bronchoalveolar lavage and protected specimen brush cultures are useful only for the diagnosis of {VAP}. Experts should collaborate to develop consensus definitions for {VAP} and {VAT} that can be applied in practice.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            During extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}), a delicate balance is required to titrate systemic anticoagulation to prevent thrombotic complications within the circuit and prevent bleeding in the patient. Despite focused efforts to achieve this balance, the frequency of both thrombotic and bleeding events remains high. Anticoagulation is complicated to manage in this population due to the complexities of the hemostatic system that are compounded by age-related developmental hemostatic changes, variable effects of the etiology of critical illness on hemostasis, and blood-circuit interaction. Lack of high-quality data to guide anticoagulation management in {ECMO} patients results in marked practice variability among centers. One aspect of anticoagulation therapy that is particularly challenging is the use of antithrombin ({AT}) supplementation for heparin resistance. This is especially controversial in the neonatal and pediatric population due to the baseline higher risk of bleeding in this cohort. The indication for {AT} supplementation is further compounded by the potential inaccuracy of the diagnosis of heparin resistance based on the standard laboratory parameters used to assess heparin effect. With concerns regarding the adverse impact of bleeding and thrombosis, clinicians and institutions are faced with making difficult, real-time decisions aimed at optimizing anticoagulation in this setting. In this clinically focused review, the authors discuss the complexities of anticoagulation monitoring and therapeutic intervention for patients on {ECMO} and examine the challenges surrounding {AT} supplementation given both the historical and current perspectives summarized in the literature on these topics.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {\textbackslash}Anticoagulation is used for stroke prophylaxis in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, amongst other by use of the vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. Quality in warfarin therapy is often summarized by the time patients spend within the therapeutic range (percent time in therapeutic range, {TTR}). The correlation between {TTR} and the occurrence of complications during warfarin therapy has been established, but the influence of patient characteristics in that respect remains undetermined. The objective of the present papers was to examine the association between mean {TTR} and complication rates with adjustment for differences in relevant patient cohort characteristics.
{METHODS}: A systematic literature search was conducted in {MEDLINE} and Embase (2005-2015) to identify eligible studies reporting on use of warfarin therapy by patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and the occurrence of hemorrhage and thromboembolism. Both randomized controlled trials and observational cohort studies were included. The association between the reported mean {TTR} and major bleeding and stroke/systemic embolism was analyzed by random-effects meta-regression with and without adjustment for relevant clinical cohort characteristics. In the adjusted meta-regressions, the impact of mean {TTR} on the occurrence of hemorrhage was adjusted for the mean age and the proportion of populations with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. In the adjusted analyses on thromboembolism, the proportion of females was, furthermore, included.
{RESULTS}: Of 2169 papers, 35 papers met pre-specified inclusion criteria, holding relevant information on 31 patient cohorts. In univariable meta-regression, increasing mean {TTR} was significantly associated with a decreased rate of both major bleeding and stroke/systemic embolism. However, after adjustment mean {TTR} was no longer significantly associated with stroke/systemic embolism. The proportion of residual variance composed by between-study heterogeneity was substantial for all analyses.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Although higher mean {TTR} in warfarin therapy was associated with lower complication rates in atrial fibrillation, the strength of the association was decreased when adjusting for differences in relevant clinical characteristics of the patient cohorts. This study suggests that mainly the safety of warfarin therapy increases with higher mean {TTR}, whereas effectiveness appears not to be substantially improved. Due to the limitations immanent in the meta-regression methods, the results of the present study should be interpreted with caution. Further research on the association between the quality of warfarin therapy and risk of complications is warranted with adjustment for clinically relevant characteristics.},

	abstract = {Time in therapeutic range ({TTR}), a well-recognized performance metric of oral anticoagulation, measures the time when patients' international normalized ratios ({INRs}) are within the desired range. The {TTR} value can vary significantly depending on the type of method used and can be a skewed indicator of the overall quality of anticoagulation. As such, the present study was designed to compare three methods for {TTR} calculation (cross-sectional, traditional, and Rosendaal) to quantify their differences, biases, and trends. As part of this investigation, a 21-week retrospective analysis of patients on warfarin was conducted to compare {TTR} values obtained by these three methods. Paired t-tests, correlation studies between size and bias, and Bland-Altman plots were performed using {SAS} 9.4 ({SAS} Institute, Cary, {NC}, {USA}). It was revealed that the {TTR} values for the cross-sectional, Rosendaal, and traditional methods were 65.97, 58.12, and 51.55, respectively. The addition of tolerances to {INR} ranges of ± 0.2 and ± 0.5 increased {TTR} values to 81.79 and 91.53, respectively, for the cross-sectional method, and 66.86 and 82.69, respectively, for the traditional method. The use of the traditional method resulted in significantly higher {TTR} values than did use of the Rosendaal method, with high variability between the methods in both positive and negative directions. There was a demonstrated lack of independence between the methods, and zero bias could not be assumed. In conclusion, the different methods considered in the present study do not accurately measure whether a patient is in or out of the therapeutic range, and the addition of tolerances can further distort the perception of anticoagulation achieved. We recommend a standardized {TTR} calculation method as well as a uniform tolerance for use in clinical trials and quality control efforts.},

While extracorporeal devices may be used acutely for limited periods of time (eg, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous venovenous hemofiltration, therapeutic apheresis), some patients require chronic use of these technologies (eg, intermittent hemodialysis and left ventricular assist devices).

	abstract = {Background
Bleeding is the most frequent complication associated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}) support in critically ill patients. Nonetheless, risk factors for bleeding have been poorly described especially those associated with coagulation anomalies and anticoagulant therapy during {ECMO} support. The aim of this study is to describe bleeding complications in critically ill patients undergoing {ECMO} and to identify risk factors for bleeding events.

Methods
We retrospectively analysed {ICU} charts of adults who received either veno-venous ({VV}) or veno-arterial ({VA}) {ECMO} support in two participating {ICUs} between 2010 and 2013. Characteristics of patients with and without bleeding complications, as per the Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation ({ELSO}) definition, were compared, and the impact of bleeding complications on patient outcomes was assessed using survival analysis. Variables that were independently associated with bleeding, including daily clinical and biological variables during {ECMO} courses, were modelled.

Results
Of the 149 {ECMO} episodes (111 {VA} {ECMO} and 38 {VV} {ECMO}) performed in 147 adults, 89 episodes (60 \%) were complicated by at least one bleeding event. The most common bleeding sources were: {ECMO} cannula (37 \%), haemothorax or cardiac tamponade (17 \%) and ear–nose and throat (16 \%). Intra-cranial haemorrhage occurred in five (2.2 \%) patients. Bleeding complications were independently associated with worse survival [adjusted hazard ratio ({HR}) 2.17, 95 \% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.07–4.41, P = 0.03]. Higher activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}) [adjusted odds ratio ({OR}) 3.00, 95 \% {CI} 1.64–5.47, P {\textless} 0.01], {APACHE} {III} score [adjusted {OR} 1.01, 95 \% {CI} 1.01–1.02, P = 0.01] and {ECMO} following surgery [adjusted {OR} 3.04, 95 \% {CI} 1.62–5.69, P {\textless} 0.01] were independently associated with greater risk of bleeding occurrence. A similar association between bleeding and higher {aPTT} was found when non-post-surgical {VA} {ECMO} was considered separately.

Conclusions
Bleeding events based on the {ELSO} bleeding definition occurred in more than 60 \% of {ECMO} episodes and were associated with hospital mortality. We identified higher {aPTT} prior bleeding as an independent risk factor for bleeding event, suggesting that better control of the {aPTT} (through a better control of either coagulopathy or anticoagulation) may improve patients’ outcome.},

	abstract = {The problem of real time prediction of blood glucose ({BG}) levels based on the readings from a continuous glucose monitoring ({CGM}) device is a problem of great importance in diabetes care, and therefore, has attracted a lot of research in recent years, especially based on machine learning. An accurate prediction with a 30, 60, or 90 min prediction horizon has the potential of saving millions of dollars in emergency care costs. In this paper, we treat the problem as one of function approximation, where the value of the {BG} level at time t+h (where h the prediction horizon) is considered to be an unknown function of d readings prior to the time t. This unknown function may be supported in particular on some unknown submanifold of the d-dimensional Euclidean space. While manifold learning is classically done in a semi-supervised setting, where the entire data has to be known in advance, we use recent ideas to achieve an accurate function approximation in a supervised setting; i.e., construct a model for the target function. We use the state-of-the-art clinically relevant {PRED}-{EGA} grid to evaluate our results, and demonstrate that for a real life dataset, our method performs better than a standard deep network, especially in hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic regimes. One noteworthy aspect of this work is that the training data and test data may come from different distributions.},

In particular, time-series {EHRs} collected by periodic medical check-up enable us to clarify the relevance among check-up results and individual environmental factors such as lifestyle. However, usually such time-series data have many missing observations and some results are strongly correlated to each other. These problems make the analysis difficult and there exists strong demand to detect clinical findings beyond them. We focus on blood test values in medical check-up results and apply a time-series analysis methodology using a state space model. It can infer the internal medical states emerged in blood test values and handle missing observations. The estimated models enable us to predict one’s blood test values under specified condition and predict the effect of intervention, such as changes of body composition and lifestyle. We use time-series data of {EHRs} periodically collected in the Hirosaki cohort study in Japan and elucidate the effect of 17 environmental factors to 38 blood test values in elderly people. Using the estimated model, we then simulate and compare time-transitions of participant’s blood test values under several lifestyle scenarios. It visualizes the impact of lifestyle changes for the prevention of diseases. Finally, we exemplify that prediction errors under participant’s actual lifestyle can be partially explained by genetic variations, and some of their effects have not been investigated by traditional association studies.},

Using our method, we were able to omit 15\% of lab tests with {\textless}5\% prediction accuracy loss.

To improve patient safety and achieve computer assisted dose monitoring and control, we took intensive care units patients into cohort and aiming at developing a data-driven machine learning model to give early warning of citric acid overdose and provide adjustment suggestions on citrate pumping rate and 10\% calcium gluconate input rate for {RCA} treatment.
{METHODS}: Patient age, gender, pumped citric acid dose value, 5\% {NaHCO}3 solvent, replacement fluid solvent, body temperature value, and replacement fluid {PH} value as clinical features, models attempted to classify patients who received regional citrate anticoagulation into correct outcome category. Four models, Adaboost, {XGBoost}, support vector machine ({SVM}) and shallow neural network, were compared on the performance of predicting outcomes. Prediction results were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
{RESULTS}: For classifying patients at the early stages of citric acid treatment, the accuracy of neutral networks model is higher than Adaboost, {XGBoost} and {SVM}, the F1-score of shallow neutral networks (90.77\%) is overall outperformed than other models (88.40\%, 82.17\% and 88.96\% for Adaboost, {XGBoost} and {SVM}). Extended experiment and validation were further conducted using the {MIMIC}-{III} database, the F1-scores for shallow neutral networks, Adaboost, {XGBoost} and {SVM} are 80.00\%, 80.46\%, 80.37\% and 78.90\%, the {AUCs} are 0.8638, 0.8086, 0.8466 and 0.7919 respectively.

We built the model from a resampled dataset created by equal stratified sampling (maintaining the same sample number in three dose-groups with a total of 3639) and performed internal and external validations. Comparing to the model trained from the raw dataset of 19,060 eligible cases, we improved the low-dose group's ideal prediction percentage from 0.7 to 9.6\% and maintained the overall performance (76.4\% vs. 75.6\%) in external validation. We further built neural network models on single-dose subsets to invest whether the subsets samples were sufficient and whether the selected factors were appropriate. The training set sizes were 1340 and 1478 for the low and high dose subsets; the corresponding ideal prediction percentages were 70.2\% and 75.1\%. The training set size for the intermediate dose varied and was 1553, 6214, and 12,429; the corresponding ideal prediction percentages were 95.6, 95.1\%, and 95.3\%.

Multiple linear regression ({LR}) is known as a conventional method to develop predictive models. Recently, machine learning approaches have been extensively implemented for warfarin dosing due to the hypothesis of non-linear association between covariates and stable warfarin dose.
{OBJECTIVE}: To extend the multiple linear regression algorithm for personalized warfarin dosing in a Korean population and compare with a machine learning--based algorithm.
{METHOD}: From this cohort study, we collected information on 650 patients taking warfarin who achieved steady state including demographic information, indications, comorbidities, comedications, habits, and genetic factors. The dataset was randomly split into training set (90\%) and test set (10\%). The {LR} and machine learning (gradient boosting machine [{GBM}]) models were developed on the training set and were evaluated on the test set.
{RESULT}: {LR} and {GBM} models were comparable in terms of accuracy of ideal dose (75.38\% and 73.85\%), correlation (0.77 and 0.73), mean absolute error (0.58 mg/day and 0.64 mg/day), and root mean square error (0.82 mg/day and 0.9 mg/day), respectively. {VKORC}1 genotype, {CYP}2C9 genotype, age, and weight were the highest contributors and could obtain 80\% of maximum performance in both models.
{CONCLUSION}: This study shows that our {LR} and {GMB} models are satisfactory to predict warfarin dose in our dataset. Both models showed similar performance and feature contribution characteristics. {LR} may be the appropriate model due to its simplicity and interpretability.},

{METHODS}: A shallow neural network model was adopted in a retrospective cohort of patients from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care {III} ({MIMIC} {III}) database and patients admitted to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital ({PUMCH}). We modeled the subtherapeutic, normal, and supratherapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}) as the outcomes of heparin treatment and used a group of clinical features for modeling. Our model classifies patients into 3 different therapeutic states. We tested the prediction ability of our model and evaluated its performance by using accuracy, the kappa coefficient, precision, recall, and the F1 score. Furthermore, a dosage recommendation module was designed and evaluated for clinical decision support.
{RESULTS}: A total of 3607 patients selected from {MIMIC} {III} and 1549 patients admitted to the {PUMCH} who met our criteria were included in this study. The shallow neural network model showed results of F1 scores 0.887 ({MIMIC} {III}) and 0.925 ({PUMCH}). When compared with the actual dosage prescribed, our model recommended increasing the dosage for 72.2\% ({MIMIC} {III}, 1240/1718) and 64.7\% ({PUMCH}, 281/434) of the subtherapeutic patients and decreasing the dosage for 80.9\% ({MIMIC} {III}, 504/623) and 76.7\% ({PUMCH}, 277/361) of the supratherapeutic patients, suggesting that the recommendations can contribute to clinical improvements and that they may effectively reduce the time to optimal dosage in the clinical setting.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The evaluation of our model for predicting heparin treatment outcomes demonstrated that the developed model is potentially applicable for reducing the misdosage of heparin and for providing appropriate decision recommendations to clinicians.},

	abstract = {{AIMS}: Most clinical risk stratification models are based on measurement at a single time-point rather than serial measurements. Artificial intelligence ({AI}) is able to predict one-dimensional outcomes from multi-dimensional datasets. Using data from Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field ({GARFIELD})-{AF} registry, a new {AI} model was developed for predicting clinical outcomes in atrial fibrillation ({AF}) patients up to 1 year based on sequential measures of prothrombin time international normalized ratio ({PT}-{INR}) within 30 days of enrolment.
{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Patients with newly diagnosed {AF} who were treated with vitamin K antagonists ({VKAs}) and had at least three measurements of {PT}-{INR} taken over the first 30 days after prescription were analysed. The {AI} model was constructed with multilayer neural network including long short-term memory and one-dimensional convolution layers. The neural network was trained using {PT}-{INR} measurements within days 0-30 after starting treatment and clinical outcomes over days 31-365 in a derivation cohort (cohorts 1-3; n = 3185). Accuracy of the {AI} model at predicting major bleed, stroke/systemic embolism ({SE}), and death was assessed in a validation cohort (cohorts 4-5; n = 1523). The model's c-statistic for predicting major bleed, stroke/{SE}, and all-cause death was 0.75, 0.70, and 0.61, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Using serial {PT}-{INR} values collected within 1 month after starting {VKA}, the new {AI} model performed better than time in therapeutic range at predicting clinical outcomes occurring up to 12 months thereafter. Serial {PT}-{INR} values contain important information that can be analysed by computer to help predict adverse clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Warfarin dosing remains challenging due to narrow therapeutic index and highly individual variability. Incorrect warfarin dosing is associated with devastating adverse events. Remarkable efforts have been made to develop the machine learning based warfarin dosing algorithms incorporating clinical factors and genetic variants such as polymorphisms in {CYP}2C9 and {VKORC}1. The most widely validated pharmacogenetic algorithm is the {IWPC} algorithm based on multivariate linear regression ({MLR}). However, with only a single algorithm, the prediction performance may reach an upper limit even with optimal parameters. Here, we present novel algorithms using stacked generalization frameworks to estimate the warfarin dose, within which different types of machine learning algorithms function together through a meta-machine learning model to maximize the prediction accuracy. Compared to the {IWPC}-derived {MLR} algorithm, Stack 1 and 2 based on stacked generalization frameworks performed significantly better overall. Subgroup analysis revealed that the mean of the percentage of patients whose predicted dose of warfarin within 20\% of the actual stable therapeutic dose (mean percentage within 20\%) for Stack 1 was improved by 12.7\% (from 42.47\% to 47.86\%) in Asians and by 13.5\% (from 22.08\% to 25.05\%) in the low-dose group compared to that for {MLR}, respectively. These data suggest that our algorithms would especially benefit patients requiring low warfarin maintenance dose, as subtle changes in warfarin dose could lead to adverse clinical events (thrombosis or bleeding) in patients with low dose. Our study offers novel pharmacogenetic algorithms for clinical trials and practice.},

	abstract = {Anticoagulation response to warfarin during the initial stage of therapy varies among individuals. In this study, we aimed to combine pharmacometabolomic and pharmacogenetic data to predict interindividual variation in warfarin response, and, on this basis, suggest an initial daily dose range. The baseline metabolic profiles, genotypes, and clinical information of 160 patients with heart valve disease served as the variables of the function of the last international normalized ratio measured before a patient's discharge ({INRday}7 ) to screen for potential biomarkers. The partial least-squares model showed that two baseline metabolites (uridine and guanosine), one single-nucleotide variation ({VKORC}1), and four clinical parameters (weight, creatinine level, amiodarone usage, and initial daily dose) had good predictive power for {INRday}7 (R2  = 0.753 for the training set, 0.643 for the test set). With these biomarkers, a machine learning algorithm (two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis-multinomial logit model) was used to predict the subgroups with extremely warfarin-sensitive or less warfarin-sensitive patients with a prediction accuracy of 91\% for the training set and 90\% for the test set, indicating that individual responses to warfarin could be effectively predicted. Based on this model, we have successfully designed an algorithm,"{IniWarD}," for predicting an effective dose range in the initial 7-day warfarin therapy. The results indicate that the daily dose range suggested by the {IniWarD} system is more appropriate than that of the conventional genotype-based method, and the risk of bleeding or thrombus due to warfarin could thus be avoided.},

Validation was conducted using an external validation cohort (270 patients recruited from August 2019 to March 2020 in 12 outpatient clinics and hospital departments). Based on the mean absolute error ({MAE}; mean of absolute differences between the actual and predicted doses), random forest regression (12.07 mg/week; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 10.39-13.76) was the best performing machine-learning technique in the external validation cohort, whereas the worst performing technique was model trees (17.59 mg/week; 95\% {CI}, 15.75-19.43). By comparison, the simple, commonly used regression technique (ordinary least squares) performed similarly to more complex supervised machine-learning techniques and achieved an {MAE} of 13.01 mg/week (95\% {CI}, 11.45-14.58). In summary, we have demonstrated that simpler regression techniques perform similarly to more complex supervised machine-learning techniques.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Decision making for the "best" treatment is particularly challenging in situations in which individual patient response to drugs can largely differ from average treatment effects. By estimating individual treatment effects ({ITEs}), we aimed to demonstrate how strokes, major bleeding events, and a composite of both could be reduced by model-assisted recommendations for a particular direct oral anticoagulant ({DOAC}).
{METHODS}: In German claims data for the calendar years 2014-2018, we selected 29 901 new users of the {DOACs} rivaroxaban and apixaban. Random forests considered binary events within 1 y to estimate {ITEs} under each {DOAC} according to the X-learner algorithm with 29 potential effect modifiers; treatment recommendations were based on these estimated {ITEs}. Model performance was evaluated by the c-for-benefit statistics, absolute risk reduction ({ARR}), and absolute risk difference ({ARD}) by trial emulation.
{RESULTS}: A significant proportion of patients would be recommended a different treatment option than they actually received. The stroke model significantly discriminated patients for higher benefit and thus indicated improved decisions by reduced outcomes (c-for-benefit: 0.56; 95\% confidence interval [0.52; 0.60]). In the group with apixaban recommendation, the model also improved the composite endpoint ({ARR}: 1.69 \% [0.39; 2.97]). In trial emulations, model-assisted recommendations significantly reduced the composite event rate ({ARD}: -0.78 \% [-1.40; -0.03]).
{CONCLUSIONS}: If prescribers are undecided about the potential benefits of different treatment options, {ITEs} can support decision making, especially if evidence is inconclusive, risk-benefit profiles of therapeutic alternatives differ significantly, and the patients' complexity deviates from "typical" study populations. In the exemplary case for {DOACs} and potentially in other situations, the significant impact could also become practically relevant if recommendations were available in an automated way as part of decision making.{HighlightsIt} was possible to calculate individual treatment effects ({ITEs}) from routine claims data for rivaroxaban and apixaban, and the characteristics between the groups with recommendation for one or the other option differed significantly.{ITEs} resulted in recommendations that were significantly superior to usual (observed) treatment allocations in terms of absolute risk reduction, both separately for stroke and in the composite endpoint of stroke and major bleeding.When similar patients from routine data were selected (precision cohorts) for patients with a strong recommendation for one option or the other, those similar patients under the respective recommendation showed a significantly better prognosis compared with the alternative option.Many steps may still be needed on the way to clinical practice, but the principle of decision support developed from routine data may point the way toward future decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {Laboratory testing is an integral tool in the management of patient care in hospitals, particularly in intensive care units ({ICUs}). There exists an inherent trade-off in the selection and timing of lab tests between considerations of the expected utility in clinical decision-making of a given test at a specific time, and the associated cost or risk it poses to the patient. In this work, we introduce a framework that learns policies for ordering lab tests which optimizes for this trade-off. Our approach uses batch off-policy reinforcement learning with a composite reward function based on clinical imperatives, applied to data that include examples of clinicians ordering labs for patients. To this end, we develop and extend principles of Pareto optimality to improve the selection of actions based on multiple reward function components while respecting typical procedural considerations and prioritization of clinical goals in the {ICU}. Our experiments show that we can estimate a policy that reduces the frequency of lab tests and optimizes timing to minimize information redundancy. We also find that the estimated policies typically suggest ordering lab tests well ahead of critical onsets-such as mechanical ventilation or dialysis-that depend on the lab results. We evaluate our approach by quantifying how these policies may initiate earlier onset of treatment.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To reduce unnecessary lab testing by predicting when a proposed future lab test is likely to contribute information gain and thereby influence clinical management in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Recent studies have demonstrated that frequent laboratory testing does not necessarily relate to better outcomes.
{DESIGN}: Data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification were performed and an artificial intelligence tool, fuzzy modeling, was used to identify lab tests that do not contribute an information gain. There were 11 input variables in total. Ten of these were derived from bedside monitor trends heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, temperature, blood pressure, and urine collections, as well as infusion products and transfusions. The final input variable was a previous value from one of the eight lab tests being predicted: calcium, {PTT}, hematocrit, fibrinogen, lactate, platelets, {INR} and hemoglobin. The outcome for each test was a binary framework defining whether a test result contributed information gain or not.
{PATIENTS}: Predictive modeling was applied to recognize unnecessary lab tests in a real world {ICU} database extract comprising 746 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding.
{MAIN} {RESULTS}: Classification accuracy of necessary and unnecessary lab tests of greater than 80\% was achieved for all eight lab tests. Sensitivity and specificity were satisfactory for all the outcomes. An average reduction of 50\% of the lab tests was obtained. This is an improvement from previously reported similar studies with average performance 37\% by [1-3].
{CONCLUSIONS}: Reducing frequent lab testing and the potential clinical and financial implications are an important issue in intensive care. In this work we present an artificial intelligence method to predict the benefit of proposed future laboratory tests. Using {ICU} data from 746 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, and eleven measurements, we demonstrate high accuracy in predicting the likely information to be gained from proposed future lab testing for eight common {GI} related lab tests.

	abstract = {Objective
To build a machine-learning model that predicts laboratory test results and provides a promising lab test reduction strategy, using spatial-temporal correlations.
Materials and methods
We developed a global prediction model to treat laboratory testing as a series of decisions by considering contextual information over time and across modalities. We validated our method using a critical care database ({MIMIC} {III}), which includes 4,570,709 observations of 12 standard laboratory tests, among 38,773 critical care patients. Our deep-learning model made real-time laboratory reduction recommendations and predicted the properties of lab tests, including values, normal/abnormal (whether labs were within the normal range) and transition (normal to abnormal or abnormal to normal from the latest lab test). We reported area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) for predicting normal/abnormal, evaluated accuracy and absolute bias on prediction vs. observation against lab test reduction proportion. We compared our model against baseline models and analyzed the impact of variations on the recommended reduction strategy.
Results
Our best model offered a 20.26 \% reduction in the number of laboratory tests. By applying the recommended reduction policy on the hold-out dataset (7755 patients), our model predicted normality/abnormality of laboratory tests with a 98.27 \% accuracy ({AUC}, 0.9885; sensitivity, 97.84 \%; specificity, 98.80 \%; {PPV}, 99.01 \%; {NPV}, 97.39 \%) on 20.26 \% reduced lab tests, and recommended 98.10 \% of transitions to be checked. Our model performed better than the greedy models, and the recommended reduction strategy was robust.
Discussion
Strong spatial and temporal correlations between laboratory tests can be used to optimize policies for reducing laboratory tests throughout the hospital course. Our method allows for iterative predictions and provides a superior solution for the dynamic decision-making laboratory reduction problem.
Conclusion
This work demonstrates a machine-learning model that assists physicians in determining which laboratory tests may be omitted.},

A machine learning model which could reliably predict low information lab tests could provide personalized, real-time predictions to discourage over-testing. To this end, we apply six standard machine learning algorithms to six years (2008-2014) of inpatient data from a tertiary academic center, to predict when the next measurement of a lab test is likely to be the “same” as the previous one. Out of 13 common inpatient lab tests selected for this analysis, several are predictably stable in many cases. This points to potential areas where machine learning approaches may identify and prevent unneeded testing before it occurs, and a methodological framework for how these tasks can be accomplished.},

	abstract = {Compared with invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation ({NIV}) has two unique characteristics: the non-hermetic nature of the system and the fact that the ventilator-lung assembly cannot be considered as a single-compartment model because of the presence of variable resistance represented by the upper airway. When {NIV} is initiated, the ventilator settings are determined empirically based on a clinical evaluation and diurnal blood gas variations. However, {NIV} is predominantly applied during sleep. Consequently, to assess overnight patient–machine ‘agreement’ and efficacy of ventilation, more specific and sophisticated monitoring is needed. The effectiveness of {NIV} might therefore be more correctly assessed by sleep studies than by daytime assessment. The most available and simple monitoring can be done from flow and pressure curves from the mask or the ventilator circuit. Examination of these tracings can give useful information to evaluate if the settings chosen by the operator were the right ones for that patient. However, as {NIV} allows a large range of ventilatory parameters and settings, it is mandatory to have information about this to better understand patient–ventilator interaction. Ventilatory modality, mode of triggering, pressurisation slope, use or not of positive end expiratory pressure and type of exhalation as well as ventilator performances may all have physiological consequences. Leaks and upper airway resistance variations may, in turn, modify these patterns. This article discusses the equipment available for {NIV}, analyses the effect of different ventilator modes and settings and of exhalation and connecting circuits on ventilatory traces and gives the background necessary to understand their impact on nocturnal monitoring of {NIV}.},

We conducted a bench-to-bedside study to assess the ventilatory quality of the {VPAPTMIII}-{ResLinkTM} ({ResMed}, North Ryde, Australia).
We tested the accuracy of minute ventilation ({MV}) and leak calculations given by {VPAPTMIII}-{ResLinkTM} compared to those measured by a bench model at varied leak levels and ventilator settings. We systematically assessed {NIV} efficacy using this system from 2003 to 2006. Ventilation was considered inadequate if leak ({\textgreater}24 L·min−1), continuous desaturation ({\textgreater}30\% of the trace) or desaturation dips ({\textgreater}3\%) were present.
On the bench test, both methods were highly correlated (r = 0.947, p{\textgreater}0.0001 and r = 0.959, p{\textless}0.0001 for leak and {MV}, respectively). We performed 222 assessments in 169 patients (aged 66.42±16 yrs, 100 males). Abnormalities were detected on 147 (66\%) out of 222 occasions. Leak was the most common abnormality (34.2\%) followed by desaturation dips (23.8\%). The most effective therapeutic solutions were a chin strap if leak was detected (61.2\%) and expiratory positive airway pressure increase for desaturation dips (59.5\%). In 15.7\% of cases, when abnormalities persisted, a polygraphy was performed.
The systematic use of this device enables {NIV} to be optimised, limiting the indication of sleep studies to complex cases.},

Depending on disease type and clinical status, {NIV} can be applied both in the general ward and in high-dependency/intensive care unit settings with different environmental opportunities. However, it is important to remember that patients with {ARF} are always very fragile with possible high mortality risk. The delay in recognition of unresponsiveness to {NIV}, progression of respiratory failure or new-onset complications may result in devastating and fatal outcomes.

	doi = {10.1186/s12931-022-01930-0},
	abstract = {Background
The comparison of respiratory system compliance (Crs) between {COVID} and non-{COVID} {ARDS} patients has been the object of debate, but few studies have evaluated it when considering applied positive end expiratory pressure ({PEEP}), which is one of the known determinants of Crs itself. The aim of this study was to compare Crs taking into account the applied {PEEP}.

Methods
Two cohorts of patients were created: those with {COVID}-{ARDS} and those with non-{COVID} {ARDS}. In the whole sample the association between Crs and type of {ARDS} at different {PEEP} levels was adjusted for anthropometric and clinical variables. As secondary analyses, patients were matched for predicted functional residual capacity and the same association was assessed. Moreover, the association between Crs and type of {ARDS} was reassessed at predefined {PEEP} level of 0, 5, 10, and 15 {cmH}2O with a propensity score-weighted linear model.

Results
367 patients were included in the study, 276 patients with {COVID}-{ARDS} and 91 with non-{COVID} {ARDS}. The association between Crs and type of {ARDS} was not significant in both the complete cohorts (p = 0.17) and in the matched cohorts (p = 0.92). This was true also for the propensity score weighted association at {PEEP} 5, 10 and 15 {cmH}2O, while it was statistically significant at {PEEP} 0 (with a median difference of 3 ml/{cmH}2O, which in our opinion is not clinically significant).

Conclusions
The compliance of the respiratory system is similar between {COVID} {ARDS} and non-{COVID} {ARDS} when calculated at the same {PEEP} level and while taking into account patients’ anthropometric characteristics.

	doi = {10.1016/j.thromres.2017.07.006},
	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: The activated partial thromboplastin time ({APTT}) is commonly used to monitor unfractionated heparin ({UFH}) but may not accurately measure the amount of heparin present. The anti-Xa assay is less susceptible to confounding factors and may be a better assay for this purpose.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: The validity of the {APTT} for monitoring {UFH} was assessed by comparing with an anti-Xa assay on 3543 samples from 475 patients (infants [n=165], children 1-15years [n=60] and adults [n=250]) receiving treatment dose {UFH}.
{RESULTS}: Overall concordance was poor. The highest concordance (66\%; 168/254) was seen in children. Concordance (51.8\%) or discordance (48.4\%) was almost equal in adult patients. Among adult patients whose anti-Xa level was within 0.3-0.7IU/{mL}, only 38\% had an {APTT} in the therapeutic range whilst 56\% were below and 6\% were above therapeutic range. Children and adult patients with anti-Xa of 0.3-0.7IU/{mL} but sub- therapeutic {APTT} had significantly higher fibrinogen levels compared to those with therapeutic or supra-therapeutic {APTT}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: When the anti-Xa level was 0.3-0.7IU/{mL}, the majority of samples from infants demonstrated a supra-therapeutic {APTT}, whilst adults tended to have a sub-therapeutic {APTT}. This may lead to under anticoagulation in infants or over anticoagulation in adults with risk of bleeding if {APTT} is used to monitor {UFH}. These results further strengthen existing evidence of the limitation of {APTT} in monitoring {UFH}. Discordance of {APTT} and anti-Xa level in adults and children may be due to elevation of fibrinogen level.},

	abstract = {Introduction:Critically ill {COVID}-19 patients are at increased risk of thrombosis with an enhanced risk of bleeding. We aimed to explore the role of anti-factor Xa levels in optimizing the high-intensity anticoagulation?s safety and efficacy and finding possible associations between D-dimer levels, cytokine storm markers, and {COVID}-19-induced coagulopathy or thrombophilia.Methods:Retrospective cohort study conducted on 69 critically ill {COVID}-19 patients who received three regimens of higher intensity anticoagulation.Results:Seventeen patients (24.6\%) received high-dose enoxaparin prophylaxis, 29 patients (42\%) received therapeutic doses of enoxaparin, and 23 patients (33.3\%) were on therapeutic unfractionated heparin infusion. Fewer than one-third of the whole cohort (n?=?22; 31.8\%) achieved the target range of anti-factor Xa. The patients were divided into three subgroups based on anti-factor Xa target status within each anticoagulation regimen; when compared, the only association observed among them was for interleukin-6 levels, which were significantly higher in both the ?above the expected range? and ?below the expected range? groups compared with the ?within the expected range? group (p?=?0.009). Major bleeding episodes occurred in 14 (20.3\%) patients and were non-significantly more frequent in the ?below the expected anti-factor Xa range group? (p?=?0.415). Seven patients (10.1\%) developed thrombosis. The majority of patients had anti-factor Xa levels below the expected ranges (four patients, 57.1\%).Conclusion:Conventional anti-factor Xa ranges may not be appropriate as a predictive surrogate for bleeding in critically ill {COVID}-19. The clinical decision to initiate therapeutic anticoagulation preemptively may be individualized according to thrombosis and bleeding risks. Cytokine storm markers, namely, interleukin-6, may play a role in {COVID}-19-induced coagulopathy or thrombophilia.},

Its circuitry requires a closely monitored anticoagulation therapy that is empirically supported by activated clotting time ({ACT})?a method often associated with large inter- and intraindividual variability. We aimed to compare the measurement of heparin activity with {ACT} and the direct measurement of the heparin activity (anti-Xa) in a large {ECMO} population.Methods:All patients treated by venoarterial or venovenous {ECMO} in our intensive care unit between January 2014 and December 2015 were prospectively included. A concomitant measurement of the anti-Xa activity and {ACT} was performed on the same sample collected twice a day (morning?evening) for unfractionated heparin adaptation with an {ACT} target range of 180 to 220 seconds.Results:One hundred and nine patients (men 69.7\%, median age 54 years) treated with {ECMO} (70.6\% venoarterial) were included. Spearman analysis found no correlation between anti-Xa and {ACT} (? {\textless} 0.4) from day 1 and worsened over time. Kappa analysis showed no agreement between the respective target ranges of {ACT} and anti-Xa.Conclusions:We demonstrate that concomitant measurement of {ACT} and anti-Xa activity is irrelevant in {ECMO} patients.

	abstract = {Due to variable pharmacokinetic properties, therapeutic anticoagulation with continuous unfractionated heparin ({UFH}) requires ongoing laboratory monitoring, generally with activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}). In the ambulatory setting, clinicians who manage warfarin therapy often use time in the therapeutic range ({TTR}) to estimate a percentage of time the international normalized ratio is therapeutic. We applied the {TTR} concept to {aPTT} monitoring for therapeutic {UFH} and used 2 methodologies for estimation: percentage of {aPTT} values in range (\%{aIR}) and a modification of the Rosendaal method (mod-Rosendaal). This study included adult inpatients admitted between September 30, 2015, and September 30, 2016, at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. For each patient, all available {aPTT} values were extracted to calculate 2 individual {TTRs} according to each methodology. Comparison between methods was performed using Student t test, and correlation was assessed with simple linear regression. A total of 255 patients were included in this study. The major outcome of {TTR} estimation was significantly higher using mod-Rosendaal (43.7\% [26.5\%]) versus \%{aIR} (37.7\% [25.7\%], P = .012) by a mean difference of 6\% points (95\% confidence interval: 1.3-10.7). Time in the therapeutic range estimated by mod-Rosendaal significantly correlated with those estimated by \%{aIR} (r = 0.84, P {\textless} .001). Further studies should evaluate the correlation between {TTR} and clinical outcomes and establish a benchmark for quality therapeutic anticoagulation with continuous {UFH}.},

	abstract = {Objective
To investigate the predictive performance of machine learning ({ML}) algorithms for estimating anticoagulation control in patients with atrial fibrillation ({AF}) who are treated with warfarin.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients (≥18 years) between 2007 and 2016 using linked primary and secondary care data (Clinical Practice Research Datalink {GOLD} and Hospital Episode Statistics). Various {ML} techniques were explored to predict suboptimal anticoagulation control, defined as time in therapeutic range ({TTR}) {\textless} 70\% based on International Normalised Ratio ({INR}) 2.0–3.0. Baseline (linear and non-linear support vector machines; random forests; stochastic gradient boosting [{XGBoost}]; neural networks [{NN}]) and time-varying data (6-week intervals up to 30 weeks (long-short term memory [{LSTM}] {NN})) were applied. Patient records depicting unique lines of warfarin therapy ({LOT}) were separated into training (70\%) and holdout sets (30\%) for model training and testing, respectively.
Results
35,479 patients were eligible for inclusion, of whom 24,684 and 10,795 were assigned to the training (32,683 unique {LOTs}) and holdout sets (14,218 unique {LOTs}). Across all models, depression (diagnosis and/or prescription of antidepressant medication) was a significant driver in predicting anticoagulation control. At baseline, {XGBoost} was the best-performing model (area under the curve [{AUC}]: 0.624) due to its ability to identify non-linear associations such as age and weight (greater probability of suboptimal control: {\textless}65 and {\textgreater}80 years and {\textless}70 kg, respectively). Addition of time-varying data to the {LSTM} {NN} improved predictive performance, plateauing at {AUC} of 0.830 at 30 weeks.
Conclusion
{ML} algorithms displayed clinically useful ability to predict patients who are at greater risk of suboptimal control. The addition of time-varying data to the algorithm, especially prior {INR} measurements, improved predictive performance. These algorithms provide improved predictive tools for identifying patients who may benefit from more frequent {INR} monitoring or switching to alternative therapies.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Studies have shown that achieving a time in therapeutic range ({TTR}) for warfarin of greater than 60\% is associated with a lower risk of bleeding. However, many patients on hemodialysis ({HD}) do not achieve this target.
Methods
We audited {TTR} achievement at the in-center {HD} unit of our hospital in 2017 and found that only 40\% of patients had achieved a {TTR} {\textgreater}60\%. We aimed to improve the percentage of {HD} patients achieving target {TTR} within 2 years. We reported each patient's individualized trend in quarterly {TTR} to their primary warfarin prescriber as an audit-feedback report. These reports were generated, disseminated, and subsequently improved following a series of plan-do-study-act cycles. We then used statistical process control to assess for changes in the percentage of {HD} patients achieving target {TTR} over time.
Results
In the primary analysis, 28 patients were included in the baseline period, and 46 were included in the intervention period. At baseline, the percentage of patients achieving a {TTR} {\textgreater}60\% varied between 33\% and 45\% (mean ± {SD}, 40\% ± 5\%); post-intervention, this metric improved and varied between 52\% and 71\% (mean ± {SD}, 61\% ± 8\%). In time-series analysis, there was evidence of statistically significant variation between the 2 periods and evidence of sustained improvement.
Conclusions
A quality improvement program consisting of an audit-feedback report that raises awareness of the quality gap in {TTR} achievement can result in substantial improvement in the safe and efficacious administration of warfarin to patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis.},

	abstract = {Background—Among patients receiving warfarin, percent time in therapeutic range ({TTR}) and international normalized ratio ({INR}) variability predict adverse events individually. Here, we examined what is added to the prediction of adverse events by using both measures together.
Methods and Results—We included 40 404 patients anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation, aged 65+, within the Veterans Health Administration. {TTR} and log-transformed {INR} variability were calculated for each patient. Our study outcomes were ischemic stroke and major bleeding, defined using International Classification of Diseases-9 codes. We estimated the hazard ratios ({HRs}) for the study outcomes using 3 nested Cox regression models, including (1) {TTR} or log {INR} variability separately; (2) {TTR} and log {INR} variability together; and (3) both predictors together plus an interaction term. We divided {TTR} into 3 categories (high, {\textgreater}70\%; moderate, 50\% to 70\%; low, {\textless}50\%) and log {INR} variability into 2 categories (stable and unstable). The reference groups high {TTR} and stable anticoagulation each denote good control. Higher log {INR} variability (ie, unstable control) predicted ischemic stroke ({HR}=1.45, P{\textless}0.001) and major bleeding ({HR}=1.57, P{\textless}0.001) independently, regardless of {TTR} levels. Our model with interaction terms showed that High log {INR} variability predicted a significantly higher risk for ischemic stroke and major bleeding compared with low log {INR} variability, at moderate {TTR} levels ({HR}= 1.27 and {HR}=1.29, respectively) and at high {TTR} levels ({HR}=1.55 and {HR}=1.56, respectively), but not at low {TTR} levels.
Conclusions—Unstable anticoagulation predicts warfarin adverse effects independent of {TTR}. Moreover, knowledge about anticoagulation stability further stratifies the risk for adverse events at given levels of {TTR}.  (Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2014;7:664-669.)},

Methods and Results-—{TTR} was calculated using the Rosendaal method, without exclusion of international normalized ratio ({INR}) values performed during warfarin initiation. Measurements during warfarin interruptions {\textgreater}7 days were excluded. {INRs} were performed via standardized ﬁnger-stick point-of-care devices at least every 4 weeks. The primary efﬁcacy endpoint (stroke or noncentral nervous system embolism) was examined by quartiles of {cTTR} and by {cTTR} as a continuous function. Centers with the highest {cTTRs} by quartile had lower-risk patients as reﬂected by lower {CHADS}2 scores (P{\textless}0.0001) and a lower prevalence of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (P{\textless}0.0001). Sites with higher {cTTR} were predominantly from North America and Western Europe. The treatment effect of rivaroxaban versus warfarin on the primary endpoint was consistent across a wide range of {cTTRs} (P value for interaction=0.71). The hazard of major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding increased with {cTTR} (P for interaction=0.001), however, the estimated reduction by rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in the hazard of intracranial hemorrhage was preserved across a wide range of threshold {cTTR} values.
Conclusions-—The treatment effect of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism is consistent regardless of {cTTR}. ( J Am Heart Assoc. 2014;3:e000521 doi: 10.1161/{JAHA}.113.000521)},

	abstract = {Warfarin is a widely used anticoagulant, and has a narrow therapeutic range. Dosing of warfarin should be individualized, since slight overdosing or underdosing can have catastrophic or even fatal consequences. Despite much research on warfarin dosing, current dosing protocols do not live up to expectations, especially for patients sensitive to warfarin. We propose a deep reinforcement learning-based dosing model for warfarin. To overcome the issue of relatively small sample sizes in dosing trials, we use a Pharmacokinetic/ Pharmacodynamic ({PK}/{PD}) model of warfarin to simulate dose-responses of virtual patients. Applying the proposed algorithm on virtual test patients shows that this model outperforms a set of clinically accepted dosing protocols by a wide margin.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Despite their potential interest for clinical management, measurements of respiratory mechanics in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) are seldom performed in routine practice. We introduced a systematic assessment of respiratory mechanics in our clinical practice. After the first year of clinical use, we retrospectively assessed whether these measurements had any influence on clinical management and physiological parameters associated with clinical outcomes by comparing their value before and after performing the test.
{METHODS}: The respiratory mechanics assessment constituted a set of bedside measurements to determine passive lung and chest wall mechanics, response to positive end-expiratory pressure, and alveolar derecruitment. It was obtained early after {ARDS} diagnosis. The results were provided to the clinical team to be used at their own discretion. We compared ventilator settings and physiological variables before and after the test. The physiological endpoints were oxygenation index, dead space, and plateau and driving pressures.
{RESULTS}: Sixty-one consecutive patients with {ARDS} were enrolled. Esophageal pressure was measured in 53 patients (86.9\%). In 41 patients (67.2\%), ventilator settings were changed after the measurements, often by reducing positive end-expiratory pressure or by switching pressure-targeted mode to volume-targeted mode. Following changes, the oxygenation index, airway plateau, and driving pressures were significantly improved, whereas the dead-space fraction remained unchanged. The oxygenation index continued to improve in the next 48 h.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Implementing a systematic respiratory mechanics test leads to frequent individual adaptations of ventilator settings and allows improvement in oxygenation indexes and reduction of the risk of overdistention at the same time.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} - {RATIONALE} {FOR} {STUDY}: Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of stroke and mortality which is reduced by treatment with warfarin. The most commonly used tool to assess the effectiveness of warfarin therapy is the time in therapeutic range ({TTR}) of International Normalised Ratio ({INR}) 2.0-3.0. Our aim was to study whether {INR} variability, as assessed by the standard deviation of transformed {INR} ({SDT}({INR})) is more prognostically important than the {TTR}.
{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We studied 19,180 patients with atrial fibrillation on warfarin therapy to evaluate the association of {TTR} and that of {SDT}({INR}) with all-cause mortality, stroke, bleeding and hospitalisation. The {SDT}({INR}) was more prognostically important than the {TTR}. One standard deviation ({SD}) higher of {SDT}({INR}) had a hazard ratio ({HR}) of 1.59 (95\% {CI} 1.52-1.66) of mortality compared with 1.18 (95\% {CI} 1.13-1.24) for one {SD} lower of {TTR}. For the other 3 events the {HR} was also higher for the {SDT}({INR}) than for the {TTR} (stroke 1.30 (95\% {CI} 1.22-1.39) vs. 1.06 (95\% {CI} 1.00-1.13), bleeding 1.27 (95\% {CI} 1.20-1.35) vs. 1.07 (95\% {CI} 1.01-1.14) , hospitalisation 1.47 (95\% {CI} 1.45-1.49) vs. 1.13 (95\% {CI} 1.10-1.15). When both metrics were included in the same analysis only the {SDT}({INR}) was of significant predictive value.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The {SDT}({INR}) is a better predictor of mortality, stroke, bleeding and hospitalisation than the {TTR} in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving warfarin therapy.},

	abstract = {Introduction The time in target International Normalized Ratio ({INR}) range ({TIR}) is used to assess the control and intensity of oral anticoagulation, but it does not measure variation in the {INR}. Objectives The value of assessing {INR} variability by use of the variance growth rate ({VGR}) as a predictor of events was investigated in patients treated with warfarin. Methods Three different methods of {VGR} determination (A, B1, and B2) together with the {TIR} were studied. Method A measures both {INR} variability and control, but methods B1 and B2 measure variability only. The {VGR} and {TIR} were determined over three time periods: overall follow-up to an event, and 6 months and 3 months before an event. Results Six hundred and sixty-one control patients were matched to 158 cases (bleeding, thromboembolism, or death). With all {VGR} methods, the risk of an event was greater in unstable patients at 6 months before an event than in stable patients. Method A demonstrated the greatest risk 3 months before an event in the unstable {VGR} group as compared with the stable group (odds ratio 3.3, 95\% confidence interval 1.9–5.7, P {\textless} 0.005). The risk of an event was 1.9 times greater in patients with a low {TIR} ({\textless} 39\%) than in those with a high {TIR} ({\textgreater} 80\%) in the 3-month period (P = 0.02). Risk of bleeding was significantly greater in the 3-month period in patients with unstable {VGR}, with the greatest risk found with method B2 (P {\textless} 0.01). Conclusions Patients with unstable anticoagulation have a significantly increased risk of ‘clinical events’ at 3 and 6 months before an event. The {VGR} can be incorporated into computer-dosage programs, and may offer additional safety when oral anticoagulation is monitored.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Variability in the intensity of anticoagulant therapy is considered a risk factor for complications, but it is unclear how best to quantify variability.
{OBJECTIVE}: We evaluated the association of three methods to measure variability with complications of oral anticoagulant therapy.
{METHODS}: We conducted a nested case-control study within a cohort of patients with prosthetic heart valves. 210 patients with a first hemorrhagic or thrombotic event during follow-up were selected with two controls per case, matched on age and sex. We calculated the time spent at an International Normalized Ratio below, above, and between 2.5 and 4.0, and the variance growth rate according to three different methods (A, B1, B2); method A combines variability and time in range, and methods B1 and B2 purely look at variability.
{RESULTS}: Odds ratios of the variance growth rates for thrombotic events for patients in the second and third tertiles varied between 2 and 3, with the highest odds ratio for complications for the method that purely looked at variability. For hemorrhagic complications, the highest odds ratios were found for method A, which also incorporated time in range, with odds ratios of 2.6 (95\% {CI}: 1.3-5.1) and 3.1 (95\% {CI}: 1.6-6.0) for the second and third tertiles as compared to the first. The combination of time spent out of range with the highest tertile of variability increased the risk 2.6-fold (95\% {CI}: 1.6-4.2) as compared to subjects with stable anticoagulation within the target range.
{CONCLUSION}: Unstable anticoagulation was associated with hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. Method A was best associated with complications, but methods B1 and B2, in combination with time spent in range, were equally well associated. As we prefer to disentangle variability and intensity of anticoagulation, we propose to use methods B1 or B2 to reflect pure variability of oral anticoagulant therapy.},

	abstract = {Most equations used for calculation of the base excess ({BE}, mmol/l) in human blood are based on the fundamental equation derived by Siggaard-Andersen and called the Van Slyke equation: {BE} = Z x [[{cHCO}3-(P) - C7.4 {HCO}3-(P)] + beta x ({pH} -7.4)]. In simple approximation, where Z is a constant which depends only on total hemoglobin concentration ({cHb}, g/dl) in blood, three equations were tested: the ones proposed by Siggaard-Andersen ({SA}), the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards ({NCCLS}) or Zander ({ZA}). They differ only slightly in the solubility factor for carbon dioxide ({alphaCO}2, mmol/l x {mmHg}) and in the apparent {pK}({pK}'), but more significantly in the plasma bicarbonate concentration at reference {pH} (C7.4HCO3-(P), mmol/l) and in beta, the slope of the {CO}2-buffer line (mmol/l) for whole blood. Furthermore, the approximation was improved either by variation in Z (r(c)), or in the apparent {pK} ({pK}) with changing {pH}. Thus, from a total of seven equations and from a reference set for {pH}, {pCO}2 and {BE} taken from the literature (n=148), the base excess was calculated. Over the whole range of base excess (-30 to +30 mmol/l) and {PCO}2 (12 to 96 {mmHg}), mean accuracy ({deltaBE}, mmol/l) was greatest in the simple equation according to Zander and decreased in the following order: +/-0.86 ({ZA}); +/-0.94 ({ZA}, r(c)); +/-0.96 ({SA}, r(c)); +/-1.03 ({NCCLS}, r(c)); +/-1.40 ({NCCLS}); +/-1.48 ({SA}); and +/-1.50 ({pK}'). For all clinical purposes, the Van Slyke equation according to Zander is the best choice and can be recommended in the following form: {BE}= (1 -0.0143 x {cHb}) x [[0.0304 x {PCO}2 x 10pH-6.1-24.26] + (9.5+1.63 x {cHb}) x ({pH} -7.4)] - 0.2 x {cHb} x (1-{sO}2), where the last term is a correction for oxygen saturation ({sO}2). Hence, base excess can be obtained with high accuracy ({\textless}1 mmol/l) from the measured quantities of {pH}, {pCO}2, {cHb}, and {SO}2 in any sample, irrespective of whether venous or arterial blood is used.},

	abstract = {Background—

Limited research has compared the measures of summarizing international normalized ratio ({INR}) control over time. Measures that are more predictive of patient outcomes would be preferred as would those that are easier to calculate and understand.

Methods and Results—

We examined 676 patients who received long-term warfarin therapy to treat atrial fibrillation: 125 patients who experienced major hemorrhage and 551 matched controls who did not. Patient {INR} control was characterized using various measures, from simple (proportion of {INR} values in range) to complex (eg, area under the curve above target range, squared) measures. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the ability of each measure to predict the outcome of clinically relevant bleeding across quintiles of control. All measures were associated with clinically relevant bleeding to some extent: patients with the poorest control had significantly more bleeding events compared with patients with the best control. The measure most strongly associated with bleeding was a combination of percent time in therapeutic range and {INR} variability (odds ratio of 4.34, comparing the lowest to the highest quintiles of control). The strongest single predictor was {INR} variability, followed closely by time in therapeutic range. More computationally complex measures, which had been expected to perform better, were not so strongly associated with bleeding.

Conclusions—

{INR} variability was the most strongly associated predictor of clinically relevant bleeding followed closely by time in therapeutic range. Using both measures together had an even stronger association. These findings support continued use of {INR} variability, time in therapeutic range, or both for research and quality assurance efforts.},

	shorttitle = {International Normalized Ratio Variability},
	abstract = {Background
As atrial fibrillation ({AF}) carries twice the mortality hazard when compared with a similar population without diagnosed {AF}, the importance of risk stratifying is obvious. Several variables are related to outcome: age, comorbidities, and use of several medications, particularly oral anticoagulants. The {CHA}2DS2VASc score is an extremely useful tool to predict thromboembolic events and also mortality. The international normalized ratio ({INR}) variability is a treatment efficacy variable also associated with morbidity in patients receiving warfarin. The objective of the study is to compare the prognostic value of the {CHA}2DS2VASc versus the {INR} variability or its combination to predict mortality.
Methods
In this observational study, we analyzed 589 patients from our Atrial Fibrillation Cohort, all on warfarin for more than 1 year and had more than 5 {INRs} performed in the last 2 years. The {CHA}2DS2VASc, {HAS}-{BLED}, and {SAMe}-{TT}2R2 scores were calculated as well as the {INR} variability using the time-in-therapeutic-range ({TTR}), the percentage of {INRs} (\%{INRs}) within range, and the standard deviation of the {INRs} ({SDINRs}). Kaplan–Meier survival curves were plotted via different cutoff points.
Results
The mean {TTR} was 53 ± 23\%; 34.6\% of the patients had a {TTR} above 64\%. The mean \%{INRs} in range was 50.2 ± 20.2; 17.3\% of the population had \%{INRs} in range above 70\%. The mean {SDINRs} was .84 ± .54, and 38.4\% had {SDINRs} below .79. Of 598, 139 (22\%) discontinued warfarin treatment. Death was responsible for almost 50\% of treatment discontinuation. Of 598, 68 patients died during the study period (11.5 \%); the most frequent causes of death were heart failure (30\%), bleeding (17\%), and ischemic stroke (15\%). Patient survival had a correlation with {TTR}, \%{INRs} in range, {SDINRs}, left ventricular ejection fraction, {CHA}2DS2VASc, and the combination of {CHA}2DS2VASc + {SDINRs} (cutoff {\textgreater}1 and {\textgreater}.79, respectively).
Conclusions
{INR} variability is an extremely useful tool to assess anticoagulation quality. Calculation of both {CHA}2DS2VASc and {INR} variability appears to be extremely useful to predict mortality in patients with {AF} receiving warfarin. The {SDINRs} emerges as a strong mortality predictor compared to the other {INR} variability indexes.},

To test the hypothesis that heart rate characteristics ({HRC}) monitoring improves neonatal outcomes.
Study design
We conducted a two-group, parallel, individually randomized controlled clinical trial of 3003 very low birth weight infants in 9 neonatal intensive care units. In one group, {HRC} monitoring was displayed; in the other, it was masked. The primary outcome was number of days alive and ventilator-free in the 120 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes were mortality, number of ventilator days, neonatal intensive care unit stay, and antibiotic use.
Results
The mortality rate was reduced in infants whose {HRC} monitoring was displayed, from 10.2\% to 8.1\% (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95\% {CI}, 0.61-0.99; P = .04; number needed to monitor = 48), and there was a trend toward increased days alive and ventilator-free (95.9 of 120 days compared with 93.6 in control subjects, P = .08). The mortality benefit was concentrated in infants with a birth weight {\textless}1000 g (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95\% {CI}, 0.57-0.95; P = .02; number needed to monitor = 23). There were no significant differences in the other outcomes.

{HRC} monitoring can reduce the mortality rate in very low birth weight infants.},

	abstract = {Rationale: If the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) is causally determined by driving pressure rather than by Vt, then the effect of ventilation with lower Vt on mortality would be predicted to vary according to respiratory system elastance (Ers). Objectives: To determine whether the mortality benefit of ventilation with lower Vt varies according to Ers. Methods: In a secondary analysis of patients from five randomized trials of lower- versus higher-Vt ventilation strategies in {ARDS} and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, the posterior probability of an interaction between the randomized Vt strategy and Ers on 60-day mortality was computed using Bayesian multivariable logistic regression. Measurements and Main Results: Of 1,096 patients available for analysis, 416 (38\%) died by Day 60. The posterior probability that the mortality benefit from lower-Vt ventilation strategies varied with Ers was 93\% (posterior median interaction odds ratio, 0.80 per cm H2O/[ml/kg]; 90\% credible interval, 0.63-1.02). Ers was classified as low ({\textless}2 cm H2O/[ml/kg], n = 321, 32\%), intermediate (2-3 cm H2O/[ml/kg], n = 475, 46\%), and high ({\textgreater}3 cm H2O/[ml/kg], n = 224, 22\%). In these groups, the posterior probabilities of an absolute risk reduction in mortality ≥ 1\% were 55\%, 82\%, and 92\%, respectively. The posterior probabilities of an absolute risk reduction ≥ 5\% were 29\%, 58\%, and 82\%, respectively. Conclusions: The mortality benefit of ventilation with lower Vt in {ARDS} varies according to elastance, suggesting that lung-protective ventilation strategies should primarily target driving pressure rather than Vt.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13054-019-2617-0},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Excessive respiratory muscle effort during mechanical ventilation may cause patient self-inflicted lung injury and load-induced diaphragm myotrauma, but there are no non-invasive methods to reliably detect elevated transpulmonary driving pressure and elevated respiratory muscle effort during assisted ventilation. We hypothesized that the swing in airway pressure generated by respiratory muscle effort under assisted ventilation when the airway is briefly occluded (ΔPocc) could be used as a highly feasible non-invasive technique to screen for these conditions.
{METHODS}: Respiratory muscle pressure (Pmus), dynamic transpulmonary driving pressure (Δ{PL},dyn, the difference between peak and end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure), and ΔPocc were measured daily in mechanically ventilated patients in two {ICUs} in Toronto, Canada. A conversion factor to predict Δ{PL},dyn and Pmus from ΔPocc was derived and validated using cross-validation. External validity was assessed in an independent cohort (Nanjing, China).
{RESULTS}: Fifty-two daily recordings were collected in 16 patients. In this sample, Pmus and Δ{PL} were frequently excessively high: Pmus exceeded 10 cm H2O on 84\% of study days and Δ{PL},dyn exceeded 15 cm H2O on 53\% of study days. ΔPocc measurements accurately detected Pmus {\textgreater} 10 cm H2O ({AUROC} 0.92, 95\% {CI} 0.83-0.97) and Δ{PL},dyn {\textgreater} 15 cm H2O ({AUROC} 0.93, 95\% {CI} 0.86-0.99). In the external validation cohort (n = 12), estimating Pmus and Δ{PL},dyn from ΔPocc measurements detected excessively high Pmus and Δ{PL},dyn with similar accuracy ({AUROC} ≥ 0.94).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Measuring ΔPocc enables accurate non-invasive detection of elevated respiratory muscle pressure and transpulmonary driving pressure. Excessive respiratory effort and transpulmonary driving pressure may be frequent in spontaneously breathing ventilated patients.},

	abstract = {{RATIONALE}: Pulmonary dead space fraction (Vd/Vt) is an independent predictor of mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}). Yet, it is seldom used in practice. The ventilatory ratio is a simple bedside index that can be calculated using routinely measured respiratory variables and is a measure of impaired ventilation. Ventilatory ratio is defined as [minute ventilation (ml/min) × {PaCO}2 (mm Hg)]/(predicted body weight × 100 × 37.5).
{OBJECTIVES}: To determine the relation of ventilatory ratio with Vd/Vt in {ARDS}.
{METHODS}: First, in a single-center, prospective observational study of {ARDS}, we tested the association of Vd/Vt with ventilatory ratio. With in-hospital mortality as the primary outcome and ventilator-free days as the secondary outcome, we tested the role of ventilatory ratio as an outcome predictor. The findings from this study were further verified in secondary analyses of two {NHLBI} {ARDS} Network randomized controlled trials.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Ventilatory ratio positively correlated with Vd/Vt. Ordinal groups of ventilatory ratio had significantly higher Vd/Vt. Ventilatory ratio was independently associated with increased risk of mortality after adjusting for {PaO}2/{FiO}2, and positive end-expiratory pressure (odds ratio, 1.51; P = 0.024) and after adjusting for Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation {II} score (odds ratio, 1.59; P = 0.04). These findings were further replicated in secondary analyses of two separate {NHLBI} randomized controlled trials.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Ventilatory ratio correlates well with Vd/Vt in {ARDS}, and higher values at baseline are associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes. These results are promising for the use of ventilatory ratio as a simple bedside index of impaired ventilation in {ARDS}.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Prone positioning is widely used in mechanically ventilated patients with {COVID}-19; however, the specific clinical scenario in which the individual is most poised to benefit is not fully established. In patients with {COVID}-19 respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, how effective is prone positioning in improving oxygenation and can that response be predicted?

Design
This is a retrospective observational study from two tertiary care centers including consecutive patients mechanically ventilated for {COVID}-19 from 3/1/2020 – 7/1/2021. The primary outcome is improvement in oxygenation as measured by {PaO}2/{FiO}2. We describe oxygenation before, during and after prone episodes with a focus on identifying patient, respiratory or ventilator variables that predict prone positioning success.

Setting
2 Tertiary Care Academic Hospitals

Patients
125 patients mechanically ventilated for {COVID}-19 respiratory failure.

Interventions
Prone positioning

Main Results
One hundred twenty-five patients underwent prone positioning a total of 309 times for a median duration of 23 hours {IQR} (14 – 49). On average, {PaO}2/{FiO}2 improved 19\%: from 115 mm Hg (80 – 148) immediately before proning to 137 mm Hg (95 – 197) immediately after returning to the supine position. Prone episodes were more successful if the pre-prone {PaO}2/{FiO}2 was lower and if the patient was on inhaled epoprostenol ({iEpo}). For individuals with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) ({PaO}2/{FiO}2 {\textless} 100 prior to prone positioning) and on {iEpo}, the median improvement in {PaO}2/{FiO}2 was 27\% in both instances.

Conclusions
Prone positioning in mechanically ventilated patients with {COVID}-19 is generally associated with sustained improvements in oxygenation, which is made more likely by the concomitant use of {iEpo} and is more impactful in those who are more severely hypoxemic prior to prone positioning.},

	abstract = {Background: 
        Acute respiratory failure occurs frequently in hospitalized patients and often begins outside the {ICU}, associated with increased length of stay, cost, and mortality. Delays in decompensation recognition are associated with worse outcomes.
        Objectives: 
        The objective of this study is to predict acute respiratory failure requiring any advanced respiratory support (including noninvasive ventilation). With the advent of the coronavirus disease pandemic, concern regarding acute respiratory failure has increased.
        Derivation Cohort: 
        All admission encounters from January 2014 to June 2017 from three hospitals in the Emory Healthcare network (82,699).
        Validation Cohort: 
        External validation cohort: all admission encounters from January 2014 to June 2017 from a fourth hospital in the Emory Healthcare network (40,143). Temporal validation cohort: all admission encounters from February to April 2020 from four hospitals in the Emory Healthcare network coronavirus disease tested (2,564) and coronavirus disease positive (389).
        Prediction Model: 
        All admission encounters had vital signs, laboratory, and demographic data extracted. Exclusion criteria included invasive mechanical ventilation started within the operating room or advanced respiratory support within the first 8 hours of admission. Encounters were discretized into hour intervals from 8 hours after admission to discharge or advanced respiratory support initiation and binary labeled for advanced respiratory support. Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment, our {eXtreme} Gradient Boosting-based algorithm, was compared against Modified Early Warning Score.
        Results: 
        Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment had significantly better discrimination than Modified Early Warning Score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.85 vs 0.57 [test], 0.84 vs 0.61 [external validation]). Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment maintained a positive predictive value (0.31–0.21) similar to that of Modified Early Warning Score greater than 4 (0.29–0.25) while identifying 6.62 (validation) to 9.58 (test) times more true positives. Furthermore, Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment performed more effectively in temporal validation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.86 [coronavirus disease tested], 0.93 [coronavirus disease positive]), while achieving identifying 4.25–4.51× more true positives.
        Conclusions: 
        Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment is more effective than Modified Early Warning Score in predicting respiratory failure requiring advanced respiratory support at external validation and in coronavirus disease 2019 patients.

	abstract = {Rationale: Two distinct phenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) with differential clinical outcomes and responses to randomly assigned treatment have consistently been identified in randomized controlled trial cohorts using latent class analysis. Plasma biomarkers, key components in phenotype identification, currently lack point-of-care assays and represent a barrier to the clinical implementation of phenotypes.

Objectives: The objective of this study was to develop models to classify {ARDS} phenotypes using readily available clinical data only.

Methods: Three randomized controlled trial cohorts served as the training data set ({ARMA} [High vs. Low Vt], {ALVEOLI} [Assessment of Low Vt and Elevated End-Expiratory Pressure to Obviate Lung Injury], and {FACTT} [Fluids and Catheter Treatment Trial]; n = 2,022), and a fourth served as the validation data set ({SAILS} [Statins for Acutely Injured Lungs from Sepsis]; n = 745). A gradient-boosted machine algorithm was used to develop classifier models using 24 variables (demographics, vital signs, laboratory, and respiratory variables) at enrollment. In two secondary analyses, the {ALVEOLI} and {FACTT} cohorts each, individually, served as the validation data set, and the remaining combined cohorts formed the training data set for each analysis. Model performance was evaluated against the latent class analysis–derived phenotype.

Measurements and Main Results: For the primary analysis, the model accurately classified the phenotypes in the validation cohort (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [{AUC}], 0.95; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.94–0.96). Using a probability cutoff of 0.5 to assign class, inflammatory biomarkers ({IL}-6, {IL}-8, and {sTNFR}-1; P {\textless} 0.0001) and 90-day mortality (38\% vs. 24\%; P = 0.0002) were significantly higher in the hyperinflammatory phenotype as classified by the model. Model accuracy was similar when {ALVEOLI} ({AUC}, 0.94; 95\% {CI}, 0.92–0.96) and {FACTT} ({AUC}, 0.94; 95\% {CI}, 0.92–0.95) were used as the validation cohorts. Significant treatment interactions were observed with the clinical classifier model–assigned phenotypes in both {ALVEOLI} (P = 0.0113) and {FACTT} (P = 0.0072) cohorts.

Conclusions: {ARDS} phenotypes can be accurately identified using machine learning models based on readily available clinical data and may enable rapid phenotype identification at the bedside.},

Results: We showed that the ﬁve selected models outperformed classical statistical methods of predictive validity and logistic regression was the most effective, being able to classify with an accuracy of 81\%. The most relevant result was ﬁnding a patient-proof where python function was able to obtain the exact dose of low weight molecular heparin to be administered and thereby to prevent the occurrence of {VTE}. Conclusions: The world of machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence is constantly developing. The identiﬁcation of a speciﬁc {LMWH} dose for preventing {VTE} in very high-risk populations, such as the {COVID}-19 and active cancer population, might improve with the use of new training {ML}-based algorithms. Larger studies are needed to conﬁrm our exploratory results.},

	abstract = {Background:  Hemorrhagic events remain a major concern in patients under extracorporeal membrane oxygena‑tion ({ECMO}) support. We tested the association between anticoagulation levels and hemorrhagic events under {ECMO} using anti-Xa activity monitoring.
Methods:  We performed a retrospective multicenter cohort study in three {ECMO} centers. All adult patients treated with veno-venous ({VV})- or veno-arterial ({VA})-{ECMO} in 6 intensive care units between September 2017 and August 2019 were included. Anti-Xa activities were collected until a hemorrhagic event in the bleeding group and for the duration of {ECMO} in the non-bleeding group. All dosages were averaged to obtain means of anti-Xa activity for each patient, and patients were compared according to the occurrence or not of bleeding.
Results:  Among 367 patients assessed for eligibility, 121 were included. Thirty-five (29\%) presented a hemorrhagic complication. In univariate analysis, anti-Xa activities were significantly higher in the bleeding group than in the nonbleeding group, both for the mean anti-Xa activity (0.38 [0.29–0.67] vs 0.33 [0.22–0.42] {IU}/{mL}; p = 0.01) and the maxi‑mal anti-Xa activity (0.83 [0.47–1.46] vs 0.66 [0.36–0.91] {IU}/{mL}; p = 0.05). In the Cox proportional hazard model, mean anti-Xa activity was associated with bleeding (p = 0.0001). By Kaplan–Meier analysis with the cutoff value at 0.46 {IU}/ {mL} obtained by {ROC} curve analysis, the probability of survival under {ECMO} without bleeding was significantly lower when mean anti-Xa was {\textgreater} 0.46 {IU}/{mL} (p = 0.0006).
Conclusion:  In critically ill patients under {ECMO}, mean anti-Xa activity was an independent risk factor for hemor‑rhagic complications. Anticoagulation targets could be revised downward in both {VV}- and {VA}-{ECMO}.},

	abstract = {Background and goal: The Random Forest ({RF}) algorithm for regression and classification has considerably gained popularity since its introduction in 2001. Meanwhile, it has grown to a standard classification approach competing with logistic regression in many innovation-friendly scientific fields.
Results: In this context, we present a large scale benchmarking experiment based on 243 real datasets comparing the prediction performance of the original version of {RF} with default parameters and {LR} as binary classification tools. Most importantly, the design of our benchmark experiment is inspired from clinical trial methodology, thus avoiding common pitfalls and major sources of biases.
Conclusion: {RF} performed better than {LR} according to the considered accuracy measured in approximately 69\% of the datasets. The mean difference between {RF} and {LR} was 0.029 (95\%-{CI}=[ 0.022, 0.038]) for the accuracy, 0.041 (95\%-{CI}=[ 0.031, 0.053]) for the Area Under the Curve, and − 0.027 (95\%-{CI}=[ −0.034, −0.021]) for the Brier score, all measures thus suggesting a significantly better performance of {RF}. As a side-result of our benchmarking experiment, we observed that the results were noticeably dependent on the inclusion criteria used to select the example datasets, thus emphasizing the importance of clear statements regarding this dataset selection process. We also stress that neutral studies similar to ours, based on a high number of datasets and carefully designed, will be necessary in the future to evaluate further variants, implementations or parameters of random forests which may yield improved accuracy compared to the original version with default values.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13054-020-03348-w},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}) support in acute respiratory failure may be lifesaving, but bleeding and thromboembolic complications are common. The optimal anticoagulation strategy balancing these factors remains to be determined. This retrospective study compared two institutional anticoagulation management strategies focussing on oxygenator changes and both bleeding and thromboembolic events.
{METHODS}: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study between 04/2015 and 02/2020 in two {ECMO} referral centres in Germany in patients receiving veno-venous ({VV})-{ECMO} support for acute respiratory failure for {\textgreater} 24 h. One centre routinely applied low-dose heparinization aiming for a partial thromboplastin time ({PTT}) of 35-40 s and the other routinely used a high-dose therapeutic heparinization strategy aiming for an activated clotting time ({ACT}) of 140-180 s. We assessed number of and time to {ECMO} oxygenator changes, 15-day freedom from oxygenator change, major bleeding events, thromboembolic events, 30-day {ICU} mortality, activated clotting time and partial thromboplastin time and administration of blood products. Primary outcome was the occurrence of oxygenator changes depending on heparinization strategy; main secondary outcomes were the occurrence of severe bleeding events and occurrence of thromboembolic events. The transfusion strategy was more liberal in the low-dose centre.
{RESULTS}: Of 375 screened patients receiving {VV}-{ECMO} support, 218 were included in the analysis (117 high-dose group; 101 low-dose group). Disease severity measured by {SAPS} {II} score was 46 ({IQR} 36-57) versus 47 ({IQR} 37-55) and {ECMO} runtime was 8 ({IQR} 5-12) versus 11 ({IQR} 7-17) days (P = 0.003). There were 14 oxygenator changes in the high-dose group versus 48 in the low-dose group. Freedom from oxygenator change at 15 days was 73\% versus 55\% (adjusted {HR} 3.34 [95\% confidence interval 1.2-9.4]; P = 0.023). Severe bleeding events occurred in 23 (19.7\%) versus 14 (13.9\%) patients (P = 0.256) and thromboembolic events occurred in 8 (6.8\%) versus 19 (19\%) patients (P = 0.007). Mortality at 30 days was 33.3\% versus 30.7\% (P = 0.11).
{CONCLUSIONS}: In this retrospective study, {ECMO} management with high-dose heparinization was associated with lower rates of oxygenator changes and thromboembolic events when compared to a low-dose heparinization strategy. Prospective, randomized trials are needed to determine the optimal anticoagulation strategy in patients receiving {ECMO} support.},

We studied the association between activated partial thromboplastin time or platelet count and the occurrence of hemorrhagic complications. The secondary objective was to determine risk factors for hemorrhagic complications.
{METHODS}: Retrospective cohort study in a single-center Dutch university hospital. We included all adult patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation admitted to the intensive care unit between 2010 and 2017.
{RESULTS}: We included 164 consecutive patients of which 73 (45\%) had a hemorrhagic complication. The most prevalent hemorrhagic complications were surgical site (62\%) and cannula site bleeding (18\%). Survival to discharge was 67\% in the patients without a hemorrhagic complication and 33\% in the patients with hemorrhagic complications (p {\textless} .01). A higher activated partial thromboplastin time in the 24 h prior was associated with the occurrence of hemorrhagic complications (adjusted hazard ratio per 10 s increase 1.14; (95\% {CI} 1.05-1.24). Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, duration of support, and higher activated partial thromboplastin time were risk factors for the occurrence of hemorrhagic complications.

	abstract = {When biological or physiological variables change over time, we are often interested in making predictions either of future measurements or of the time taken to reach some threshold value. On the basis of longitudinal data for multiple individuals, we develop Bayesian hierarchical models for making these predictions together with their associated uncertainty. Particular aspects addressed, which include some novel components, are handling curvature in individuals' trends over time, making predictions for both underlying and measured levels, making predictions from a single baseline measurement, making predictions from a series of measurements, allowing flexibility in the error and random-effects distributions, and including covariates. In the context of data on the expansion of abdominal aortic aneurysms over time, where reaching a certain threshold leads to referral for surgery, we discuss the practical application of these models to the planning of monitoring intervals in a national screening programme. Prediction of the time to reach a threshold was too imprecise to be practically useful, and we focus instead on limiting the probability of exceeding the threshold after given time intervals. Although more complex models can be shown to fit the data better, we find that relatively simple models seem to be adequate for planning monitoring intervals.},

	abstract = {Background: Major bleeding has been a common and serious complication with poor outcomes in {ECMO} patients. With a novel, less-invasive cannulation approach and closer coagulation monitoring regime, the incidence of major bleeding is currently not determined yet. Our study aims to examine the incidence of major bleeding, its determinants, and association with mortality in peripheral-{ECMO} patients.
Method: We conducted a single-center retrospective study on adult patients undergoing peripheral-{ECMO} between January 2019 and January 2020 at a tertiary referral hospital. Determinants of major bleeding were defined by logistic regression analysis. Risk factors of in-hospital mortality were determined by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.
Results: Major bleeding was reported in 33/105 patients (31.4\%) and was associated with higher in-hospital mortality [adjusted hazard ratio ({aHR}) 3.56, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.63-7.80, p {\textless} 0.001). There were no significant difference in age, sex, {ECMO} indications, {ECMO} modality, pre-{ECMO} {APACHE}-{II} and {SOFA} scores between two groups with and without major bleeding. Only {APTT} {\textgreater}72 seconds [adjusted odds ratio ({aOR}) 7.10, 95\% {CI} 2.60-19.50, p {\textless} 0.001], fibrinogen {\textless}2 g/L [{aOR} = 7.10, 95\% {CI} 2.60-19.50, p {\textless} 0.001], and {ACT} {\textgreater}220 seconds [{aOR} = 3.9, 95\% {CI} 1.20-11.80, p=0.017] on days with major bleeding were independent predictors.
Conclusions: In summary, major bleeding still had a fairly high incidence and poor outcome in peripheral-{ECMO} patients. {APTT} {\textgreater} 72 seconds, fibrinogen {\textless} 2 g/L were the strongest predicting factors for major bleeding events.},

{METHODS}: Embase, {PubMed}, {CINAHL}, Web of Science, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts and {IEEE} Xplore databases were searched from inception to 31 January 2020 to identify relevant studies using key search terms synonymous with artificial intelligence or {ML}, 'prediction', 'dose', 'activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT})' and '{UFH}.' Studies had to have used {ML} methods for developing models that predicted optimal dose of {UFH} or target therapeutic {aPTT} levels in the hospital setting. The {CHARMS} Checklist was used to assess quality and risk of bias of included studies.
{RESULTS}: Of 8393 retrieved abstracts, 61 underwent full text review and eight studies met inclusion criteria. Four studies described models for predicting {aPTT}, three studies described models predicting optimal dose of heparin during dialysis and one study described a model that used surrogate outcomes of clotting and bleeding to predict a therapeutic {aPTT}. Studies varied widely in reporting of study participants, feature characterisation and selection, handling of missing data, sample size calculations and the intended clinical application of the model. Only one study conducted an external validation and no studies evaluated model impacts in clinical practice.
{CONCLUSION}: Studies of {ML} models for {UFH} dosing are few and none report a model ready for routine clinical use. Existing studies are limited by low methodological quality, inadequate reporting of study factors and absence of external validation and impact analysis.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To determine whether there is a difference between an activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}) based unfractionated heparin ({UFH}) protocol versus an antifactor Xa based {UFH} protocol with respect to 24-hour attainment of therapeutic levels.
{METHODS}: This was an observational study performed at a 500 bed private, community hospital. The study included inpatients from January 2008 to December 2009 on our institution's {aPTT} {UFH} protocol and inpatients from July 2010 to March 2011 on our institution's antifactor Xa {UFH} protocol. The two groups were compared to determine whether a higher percentage of patients reached therapeutic goal within 24 hours of {UFH} initiation. Secondary outcomes evaluated the percentage of patients at therapeutic goal within 6 and 12 hours, incidence of bleeding, and number of {UFH} dosage adjustments within 24 hours between the two groups.
{RESULTS}: One hundred twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria for this study; 79 in the {aPTT} group and 42 in the antifactor Xa group. At 24 hours, 74\% of patients in the antifactor Xa group were at goal, versus 63\% of patients in the {aPTT} group (p = 0.242). Nearly 57\% of patients in the antifactor Xa group were at goal versus 27\% in the {aPTT} group within 6 hours (p = 0.001). Subjects in the antifactor Xa group averaged 1.00 dosage adjustments per subject as compared to an 1.71 dosage adjustments per subject in the {aPTT} group within the first 24 hours (p = 0.003).
{CONCLUSION}: The antifactor Xa assay should be used to monitor {UFH} versus {aPTT} due to less variability in measurements, the absence of a need for calibration with new reagents/coagulometers, quicker attainment of therapeutic levels, fewer dose adjustments, and similar bleeding rates.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Low tidal volume ({TVe}) ventilation improves outcomes for ventilated patients, and the majority of clinicians state they implement it. Unfortunately, most patients never receive low {TVes}. ‘Nudges’ influence decision-making with subtle cognitive mechanisms and are effective in many contexts. There have been few studies examining their impact on clinical decision-making. We investigated the impact of 2 interventions designed using principles from behavioural science on the deployment of low {TVe} ventilation in the intensive care unit ({ICU}).

Setting
University Hospitals Bristol, a tertiary, mixed medical and surgical {ICU} with 20 beds, admitting over 1300 patients per year.

Participants
Data were collected from 2144 consecutive patients receiving controlled mechanical ventilation for more than 1 hour between October 2010 and September 2014. Patients on controlled mechanical ventilation for more than 20 hours were included in the final analysis.

Interventions
(1) Default ventilator settings were adjusted to comply with low {TVe} targets from the initiation of ventilation unless actively changed by a clinician. (2) A large dashboard was deployed displaying {TVes} in the format {mL}/kg ideal body weight ({IBW}) with alerts when {TVes} were excessive.

Primary outcome measure
{TVe} in {mL}/kg {IBW}.

Findings
{TVe} was significantly lower in the defaults group. In the dashboard intervention, {TVe} fell more quickly and by a greater amount after a {TVe} of 8 {mL}/kg {IBW} was breached when compared with controls. This effect improved in each subsequent year for 3 years.

Conclusions
This study has demonstrated that adjustment of default ventilator settings and a dashboard with alerts for excessive {TVe} can significantly influence clinical decision-making. This offers a promising strategy to improve compliance with low {TVe} ventilation, and suggests that using insights from behavioural science has potential to improve the translation of evidence into practice.},

	abstract = {The clinical outcome of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection varies widely between individuals. Machine learning models can support decision making in healthcare by assessing fatality risk in patients that do not yet show severe signs of {COVID}-19. Most predictive models rely on static demographic features and clinical values obtained upon hospitalization. However, time-dependent biomarkers associated with {COVID}-19 severity, such as antibody titers, can substantially contribute to the development of more accurate outcome models. Here we show that models trained on immune biomarkers, longitudinally monitored throughout hospitalization, predicted mortality and were more accurate than models based on demographic and clinical data upon hospital admission. Our best-performing predictive models were based on the temporal analysis of anti-{SARS}-{CoV}-2 Spike {IgG} titers, white blood cell ({WBC}), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. These biomarkers, together with C-reactive protein and blood urea nitrogen levels, were found to correlate with severity of disease and mortality in a time-dependent manner. Shapley additive explanations of our model revealed the higher predictive value of day post-symptom onset ({PSO}) as hospitalization progresses and showed how immune biomarkers contribute to predict mortality. In sum, we demonstrate that the kinetics of immune biomarkers can inform clinical models to serve as a powerful monitoring tool for predicting fatality risk in hospitalized {COVID}-19 patients, underscoring the importance of contextualizing clinical parameters according to their time post-symptom onset.},

Individuals who are disease-free earlier may develop the disease later due to longer study follow-up, and also their marker value may change from baseline during follow-up.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {ARDS} is an important clinical problem. The definition of {ARDS} requires testing of arterial blood gas to define the ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 (Pao2/Fio2 ratio). However, many patients with {ARDS} do not undergo blood gas measurement, which may result in underdiagnosis of the condition. As a consequence, a method for estimating Pao2 on the basis of noninvasive measurements is desirable.
{METHODS}: Using data from three {ARDS} Network studies, we analyzed the enrollment arterial blood gas measurements to compare nonlinear with linear and log-linear imputation methods of estimating Pao2 from percent saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2). We compared mortality on the basis of various measured and imputed Pao2/Fio2 ratio cutoffs to ensure clinical equivalence.
{RESULTS}: We studied 1,184 patients, in 707 of whom the Spo2 ≤ 96\%. Nonlinear imputation from the Spo2/Fio2 ratio resulted in lower error than linear or log-linear imputation (P {\textless} .001) for patients with Spo2 ≤ 96\% but was equivalent to log-linear imputation in all patients. Ninety-day hospital mortality was 26\% to 30\%, depending on the Pao2/Fio2 ratio, whether nonlinearly imputed or measured. On multivariate regression, the association between imputed and measured Pao2 varied by use of vasopressors and Spo2.
{CONCLUSIONS}: A nonlinear equation more accurately imputes Pao2/Fio2 from Spo2/Fio2 than linear or log-linear equations, with similar observed hospital mortality depending on Spo2/Fio2 ratio vs measured Pao2/Fio2 ratios. While further refinement through prospective validation is indicated, a nonlinear imputation appears superior to prior approaches to imputation.},

The guidelines lower the blood pressure threshold defining hypertension and promote more aggressive treatments. Thus, more individuals are now classified as hypertensive and as a result, medication usage may become more extensive. An inevitable byproduct of greater medication use is higher incidence of adverse effects. Here, we examined these issues by developing models that predict both cardiovascular events and other adverse events based on the treatment chosen and other patient’s data. Methods and results We used data from the {SPRINT} trial to produce patient-specific predictions of the risks for adverse cardiovascular or kidney outcomes. Unlike prior models, we used both the baseline characteristics collected upon recruitment and the longitudinal data during the follow-up. Importantly, our cardiovascular predictor outperformed extant models on {SPRINT} participants, achieving {AUC} = 0.765, and was validated with good performance in an independent cohort of the {ACCORD} trial.

We demonstrate the use of these methods for prognosis of medical outcomes of severe trauma patients, a field in which current medical practice involves rules of thumb and scoring methods that only use a few variables and ignore the dynamic and high-dimensional nature of trauma recovery. Well-principled prediction and {VIM} methods can provide a tool to make care decisions informed by the high-dimensional patient’s physiological and clinical history. Our {VIM} parameters are analogous to slope coefficients in adjusted regressions, but are not dependent on a specific statistical model, nor require a certain functional form of the prediction regression to be estimated. In addition, they can be causally interpreted under causal and statistical assumptions as the expected outcome under time-specific clinical interventions, related to changes in the mean of the outcome if each individual experiences a specified change in the variable (keeping other variables in the model fixed). Better yet, the targeted {MLE} used is doubly robust and locally efficient. Because the proposed {VIM} does not constrain the prediction model fit, we use a very flexible ensemble learner (the {SuperLearner}), which returns a linear combination of a list of user-given algorithms. Not only is such a prediction algorithm intuitive appealing, it has theoretical justification as being asymptotically equivalent to the oracle selector. The results of the analysis show effects whose size and significance would have been not been found using a parametric approach (such as stepwise regression or {LASSO}). In addition, the procedure is even more compelling as the predictor on which it is based showed significant improvements in cross-validated fit, for instance area under the curve ({AUC}) for a receiver-operator curve ({ROC}). Thus, given that 1) our {VIM} applies to any model fitting procedure, 2) under assumptions has meaningful clinical (causal) interpretations and 3) has asymptotic (influence-curve) based robust inference, it provides a compelling alternative to existing methods for estimating variable importance in high-dimensional clinical (or other) data.},

	abstract = {In longitudinal studies, prognostic biomarkers are often measured longitudinally. It is of both scientific and clinical interest to predict the risk of clinical events, such as disease progression or death, using these longitudinal biomarkers as well as other time-dependent and time-independent information about the patient. The prediction is dynamic in the sense that it can be made at any time during the follow-up, adapting to the changing at-risk population and incorporating the most recent longitudinal data. One approach is to build a joint model of longitudinal predictor variables and time to the clinical event, and draw predictions from the posterior distribution of the time to event conditional on longitudinal history. Another approach is to use the landmark model, which is a system of prediction models that evolve with the follow-up time. We review the pros and cons of the two approaches, and present a general analytical framework using the landmark approach. The proposed framework allows the measurement times of longitudinal data to be irregularly spaced and differ between subjects. We propose a unified kernel weighting approach for estimating the model parameters, calculating predicted probabilities, and evaluating prediction accuracy through double time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristics ({ROC}) curves. We illustrate the proposed analytical framework using the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension ({AASK}) to develop a landmark model for dynamic prediction of end stage renal diseases or death among patients with chronic kidney disease.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Chronic kidney disease ({CKD}), commonly described by estimated glomerular filtration rate ({eGFR}), is a frequent comorbidity in patients with atrial fibrillation ({AF}) and associated with thromboembolic and bleeding complications. Instead of single {eGFR} measurements, kidney function decline over time may better predict clinical outcomes but this has not been studied so far.
{METHODS}: Patients with {AF} and stage 3/4 {CKD} were prospectively followed within a primary care electronic database from the United Kingdom ({IMS}-{THIN}). The associations between the longitudinal {eGFR} trajectory of these patients and stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, first hospitalization-for-any-cause, and death-from-any-cause were estimated with joint models of longitudinal and time-to-event data.
{RESULTS}: 18,240 patients were included (median age 80.4 years, median {CHA}2DS2-{VASc} score 4). In 133,676 {eGFR} measurements (mean: 6 per patient) median "baseline" {eGFR} was 49 ml/min/1.73m2 [41-55] and mean {eGFR} decline was 0.54 ml/min/1.73m2/year (95\%{CI}: 0.47-0.62). During follow-up (median 3.2 years; 50,841 patient-years at risk), 5-year cumulative incidence estimates were 9\%, 3\%, 32\% and 76\% for stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, hospitalization and death, respectively. In joint modeling, an accelerated decline in kidney function strongly predicted for a higher risk of major bleeding (hazard ratio [{HR}] 1.09 per ml/min/1.73m2/year increase in {eGFR} decline), hospitalization ({HR} 1.06), and death-from-any-cause ({HR} 1.11; all p {\textless} 0.05), but not for stroke/systemic embolism ({HR} 0.97; p = 0.239).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Declining kidney function is a critical determinant of unfavourable outcomes in patients with {AF} and {CKD}. Longitudinal kidney function trajectories may enable a much more individualized prediction of adverse outcomes in this vulnerable patient population.},

Ventilators available for clinical use have different levels of complexity, and clinicians need to know in detail their characteristics, setting variables, and performances. A wide range of ventilators are currently used in non-invasive ventilation including bi-level ventilators, intermediate ventilators, and critical care ventilators. Simple or advanced continuous positive airway pressure devices are also available. Differences between ventilators may have implications on the development of asynchronies and air leaks and may be associated with discomfort and poor patient tolerance. Although pressure-targeted (controlled) mode is preferable in children because of barotrauma concerns, volume-targeted (controlled) ventilators are also available. Pressure support ventilation represents the most used non-invasive ventilation mode, as it is more physiological. The newest ventilators allow the clinicians to use the hybrid modes that combine the advantages of volume- and pressure-targeted (controlled) ventilation while limiting their drawbacks. The use of in-built software may help clinicians to optimize the ventilator setting as well as to objectively monitor patient adherence to the treatment.

	abstract = {Rationale Acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) affects over 200 000 people annually in the {USA}. Despite causing severe, and often refractory, hypoxaemia, the high mortality and long-term morbidity of {ARDS} results mainly from extra-pulmonary organ failure; however the mechanism for this organ crosstalk has not been determined.
Methods Using autologous radiolabelled neutrophils we investigated the pulmonary transit of primed and unprimed neutrophils in humans. Flow cytometry of whole blood samples was used to assess transpulmonary neutrophil priming gradients in patients with {ARDS}, sepsis and perioperative controls.
Main results Unprimed neutrophils passed through the lungs with a transit time of 14.2 s, only 2.3 s slower than erythrocytes, and with {\textless}5\% first-pass retention. Over 97\% of neutrophils primed ex vivo with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor were retained on first pass, with 48\% still remaining in the lungs at 40 min. Neutrophils exposed to platelet-activating factor were initially retained but subsequently released such that only 14\% remained in the lungs at 40 min. Significant transpulmonary gradients of neutrophil {CD}62L cell surface expression were observed in {ARDS} compared with perioperative controls and patients with sepsis.
Conclusions We demonstrated minimal delay and retention of unprimed neutrophils transiting the healthy human pulmonary vasculature, but marked retention of primed neutrophils; these latter cells then ‘deprime’ and are re-released into the systemic circulation. Further, we show that this physiological depriming mechanism may fail in patients with {ARDS}, resulting in increased numbers of primed neutrophils within the systemic circulation. This identifies a potential mechanism for the remote organ damage observed in patients with {ARDS}.},

	shorttitle = {Driving pressure and mechanical power},
	abstract = {Several factors have been recognized as possible triggers of ventilator-induced lung injury ({VILI}). The first is pressure (thus the ‘barotrauma’), then the volume (hence the ‘volutrauma’), finally the cyclic opening-closing of the lung units (‘atelectrauma’). Less attention has been paid to the respiratory rate and the flow, although both theoretical considerations and experimental evidence attribute them a significant role in the generation of {VILI}. The initial injury to the lung parenchyma is necessarily mechanical and it could manifest as an unphysiological distortion of the extracellular matrix and/or as micro-fractures in the hyaluronan, likely the most fragile polymer embedded in the matrix. The order of magnitude of the energy required to break a molecular bond between the hyaluronan and the associated protein is 1.12×10-16 Joules (J), 70–90\% higher than the average energy delivered by a single breath of 1L assuming a lung elastance of 10 {cmH}2O/L (0.5 J). With a normal statistical distribution of the bond strength some polymers will be exposed each cycle to an energy large enough to rupture. Both the extracellular matrix distortion and the polymer fractures lead to inflammatory increase of capillary permeability with edema if a pulmonary blood flow is sufficient. The mediation analysis of higher vs. lower tidal volume and {PEEP} studies suggests that the driving pressure, more than tidal volume, is the best predictor of {VILI}, as inferred by increased mortality. This is not surprising, as both tidal volume and respiratory system elastance (resulting in driving pressure) may independently contribute to the mortality. For the same elastance driving pressure is a predictor similar to plateau pressure or tidal volume. Driving pressure is one of the components of the mechanical power, which also includes respiratory rate, flow and {PEEP}. Finding the threshold for mechanical power would greatly simplify assessment and prevention of {VILI}.},

	abstract = {Tidal volume delivered by mechanical ventilation to a sedated patient is distributed in a nonphysiological pattern, causing atelectasis (underinflation) and overdistension (overinflation). Activation of the diaphragm during controlled mechanical ventilation in these sedated patients may provide a method to reduce atelectasis and alveolar inhomogeneity, protecting the lungs from ventilator-induced lung injury while also protecting the diaphragm by preventing ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction. We studied the hypothesis that diaphragm contractions elicited by transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation, delivered in synchrony with volume-control ventilation, would reduce atelectasis and lung inhomogeneity in a healthy, normal lung pig model. Twenty-five large pigs were ventilated for 50 h with lung-protective volume-control ventilation combined with synchronous transvenous phrenic-nerve neurostimulation on every breath, or every second breath. This was compared to lung-protective ventilation alone. Lung mechanics and ventilation pressures were measured using esophageal pressure manometry and electrical impedance tomography. Alveolar homogeneity was measured using alveolar chord length of preserved lung tissue. Lung injury was measured using inflammatory cytokine concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum. We found that diaphragm neurostimulation on every breath preserved {PaO}2/{FIO}2 and significantly reduced the loss of end-expiratory lung volume after 50 h of mechanical ventilation. Neurostimulation on every breath reduced plateau and driving pressures, improved both static and dynamic compliance and resulted in less alveolar inhomogeneity. These findings support that temporary transvenous diaphragm neurostimulation during volume-controlled, lung-protective ventilation may offer a potential method to provide both lung- and diaphragm-protective ventilation.

{NEW} \& {NOTEWORTHY} Temporary transvenous diaphragm neurostimulation has been shown to mitigate diaphragm atrophy in a preclinical model. This study contributes to this work by demonstrating that diaphragm neurostimulation can also offer lung protection from ventilator injury, providing a potential solution to the dilemma of lung- versus diaphragm-protective ventilation. Our findings show that neurostimulation on every breath preserved {PaO}2/{FIO}2, end-expiratory lung volume, alveolar homogeneity, and required lower pressures than lung-protective ventilation over 50 h in healthy pigs.},

An 11-member international jury answered five pre-defined questions. 1) What is known about the epidemiology of weaning problems? 2) What is the pathophysiology of weaning failure? 3) What is the usual process of initial weaning from the ventilator? 4) Is there a role for different ventilator modes in more difficult weaning? 5) How should patients with prolonged weaning failure be managed? The main recommendations were as follows. 1) Patients should be categorised into three groups based on the difficulty and duration of the weaning process. 2) Weaning should be considered as early as possible. 3) A spontaneous breathing trial is the major diagnostic test to determine whether patients can be successfully extubated. 4) The initial trial should last 30 min and consist of either T-tube breathing or low levels of pressure support. 5) Pressure support or assist–control ventilation modes should be favoured in patients failing an initial trial/trials. 6) Noninvasive ventilation techniques should be considered in selected patients to shorten the duration of intubation but should not be routinely used as a tool for extubation failure.},

	shorttitle = {A comprehensive protocol for ventilator weaning and extubation},
	abstract = {Background: Ventilator weaning protocols have been shown to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation ({MV}), intensive care unit length of stay, and resource use. However, weaning protocols have not significantly affected mortality or reintubation rates. The extubation process is a critical component of respiratory care in patients who receive {MV}. Post-extubation respiratory failure ({PERF}) is a common event associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that a comprehensive protocol for ventilator weaning and extubation would be effective for preventing {PERF} and reintubation and reducing mortality in critically ill patients.
Methods: A ventilator weaning and extubation protocol was developed. The protocol consisted of checklists across four evaluations: spontaneous breathing trial, extubation, prophylactic non-invasive positive pressure ventilation ({NPPV}), and evaluation after extubation. Observational data were collected after implementing the protocol in patients admitted to the Advanced Emergency and Critical Care Center of Shinshu University Hospital. Not only outcomes of patients but also influences of each component of the protocol on the clinical decision-making process were investigated. Further, a comparison between {PERF} and non-{PERF} patients was performed.
Results: A total of 464 consecutive patients received {MV} for more than 48 h, and 248 (77 women; mean age, 65 ± 17 years) were deemed eligible. The overall {PERF} and reintubation rates were 9.7\% and 5.2\%, respectively. Overall, 54.1\% of patients with {PERF} received reintubation. Hospital stay and mortality were not significantly different between {PERF} and non-{PERF} patients (p = 0.16 and 0.057, respectively). As a result, the 28-day and hospital mortality were 1.2\% and 6.9\%, respectively.
Conclusions: We found that the rates of {PERF}, reintubation, and hospital mortality were lower than those in previous reports even with nearly the same degree of severity at extubation. The comprehensive protocol for ventilator weaning and extubation may prevent {PERF} and reintubation and reduce mortality in critically ill patients.},

Does it affect length of stay, reintubation, tracheostomy, survival, or the need for post-extubation non-invasive ventilation? Is it tolerable and does it cause adverse events? Design: Systematic review of randomised trials. Participants: Adults receiving mechanical ventilation. Intervention: Inspiratory muscle training versus sham or no inspiratory muscle training. Outcome measures: Data were extracted regarding: inspiratory muscle strength and endurance; the rapid shallow breathing index; weaning success and duration; duration of mechanical ventilation; reintubation; tracheostomy; length of stay; use of noninvasive ventilation after extubation; survival; readmission; tolerability and adverse events. Results: Ten studies involving 394 participants were included. Heterogeneity within some meta-analyses was high. Random-effects meta-analyses showed that the training signiﬁcantly improved maximal inspiratory pressure ({MD} 7 {cmH}2O, 95\% {CI} 5 to 9), the rapid shallow breathing index ({MD} 15 breaths/min/l, 95\% {CI} 8 to 23) and weaning success ({RR} 1.34, 95\% {CI} 1.02 to 1.76). Although only assessed in individual studies, signiﬁcant beneﬁts were also reported for the time spent on non-invasive ventilation after weaning ({MD} 16 hours, 95\% {CI} 13 to 18), length of stay in the intensive care unit ({MD} 4.5 days, 95\% {CI} 3.6 to 5.4) and length of stay in hospital ({MD} 4.4 days, 95\% {CI} 3.4 to 5.5). Weaning duration decreased in the subgroup of patients with known weaning difﬁculty. The other outcomes weren’t signiﬁcantly affected or weren’t measured. Conclusion: Inspiratory muscle training for selected patients in the intensive care unit facilitates weaning, with potential reductions in length of stay and the duration of non-invasive ventilatory support after extubation. The heterogeneity among the results suggests that the effects of inspiratory muscle training may vary; this perhaps depends on factors such as the components of usual care or the patient’s characteristics.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Among patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, 30-day postoperative mortality is around 10-15\%. The risk of death among these patients, however, varies greatly because of their clinical characteristics. We developed a risk prediction model for 30-day postoperative mortality to enable better comparison of outcomes between hospitals.
{METHODS}: We analysed data from the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit ({NELA}) on patients having an emergency laparotomy between December 2013 and November 2015. A prediction model was developed using multivariable logistic regression, with potential risk factors identified from existing prediction models, national guidelines, and clinical experts. Continuous risk factors were transformed if necessary to reflect their non-linear relationship with 30-day mortality. The performance of the model was assessed in terms of its calibration and discrimination. Interval validation was conducted using bootstrap resampling.
{RESULTS}: There were 4458 (11.5\%) deaths within 30-days among the 38 830 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. Variables associated with death included (among others): age, blood pressure, heart rate, physiological variables, malignancy, and {ASA} physical status classification. The predicted risk of death among patients ranged from 1\% to 50\%. The model demonstrated excellent calibration and discrimination, with a C-statistic of 0.863 (95\% confidence interval, 0.858-0.867). The model retained its high discrimination during internal validation, with a bootstrap derived C-statistic of 0.861.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The {NELA} risk prediction model for emergency laparotomies discriminates well between low- and high-risk patients and is suitable for producing risk-adjusted provider mortality statistics.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: This study aimed at analyzing the prevalence, mortality association, and risk factors for bleeding and thrombosis events ({BTEs}) among adults supported with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({VV}-{ECMO}).
{METHODS}: We queried the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry for adults supported with {VV}-{ECMO} from 2010 to 2017. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to assess the association between {BTEs} and in-hospital mortality and the predictors of {BTEs}.
{RESULTS}: Among 7579 {VV}-{ECMO} patients meeting criteria, 40.2\% experienced ≥ 1 {BTE}. Thrombotic events comprised 54.9\% of all {BTEs} and were predominantly {ECMO} circuit thrombosis. {BTE} rates decreased significantly over the study period (p {\textless} 0.001). The inpatient mortality rate was 34.9\%. Bleeding events (1.69 [1.49-1.93]) were more strongly associated with in-hospital mortality than thrombotic events (1.23 [1.08-1.41]) p {\textless} 0.01 for both. The {BTEs} most strongly associated with mortality were ischemic stroke (4.50 [2.55-7.97]) and medical bleeding, including intracranial (5.71 [4.02-8.09]), pulmonary (2.02 [1.54-2.67]), and gastrointestinal (1.54 [1.2-1.98]) hemorrhage, all p {\textless} 0.01. Risk factors for bleeding included acute kidney injury and pre-{ECMO} vasopressor support and for thrombosis were higher weight, multisite cannulation, pre-{ECMO} arrest, and higher {PaCO}2 at {ECMO} initiation. Longer time on {ECMO}, younger age, higher {pH}, and earlier year of support were associated with bleeding and thrombosis.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Although decreasing over time, {BTEs} remain common during {VV}-{ECMO} and have a strong, cumulative association with in-hospital mortality. Thrombotic events are more frequent, but bleeding carries a higher risk of inpatient mortality. Differential risk factors for bleeding and thrombotic complications exist, raising the possibility of a tailored approach to {VV}-{ECMO} management.},

The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of circuit exchange during {ECMO}. This is a single-center, retrospective study of all patients who received {ECMO} at our institution from January 2010 to December 2015.

D-dimer ({DD}) (μg/{mL}) (mean difference −2.6; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: −4.2 to −1.1; p = .001) increased significantly in the 3 days leading up to {MO} exchange, whereas fibrinogen (mg/{dL}) (mean difference 90.7; 95\% {CI}: 41.8–139.6; p = .001), platelet ({PLT}) count (1,000/μL) (mean difference 23.3; 95\% {CI}: 10.2–36.4; p = .001), and heparin dose (units/h) (mean difference 261.7; 95\% {CI}: 46.3–477.1; p = .02) decreased. Increasing {DD} or decreasing fibrinogen, {PLT} count, or heparin dose may indicate an impending need for {MO} exchange in patients receiving {ECMO}.

	abstract = {Objective Failure of membrane oxygenator ({MO}) function of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenators ({VV} {ECMO}) remains problematic. The development of device-induced coagulation disorder ({COD}) or worsened gas transfer ({WGT}) necessitates a system exchange. The aim was to correlate von Willebrand factor antigen ({vWF}:Ag) with the predisposition to {MO} failure and mortality. Methods Laboratory parameters (inflammation, coagulation) and {ECMO}-related data from 31 {VV} {ECMO} patients were analyzed before and after the first {MO} exchange. Study groups were identified according to the exchange reasons ({COD}, {WGT}) and the extent of {vWF}:Ag (low, ≤425\%; high, {\textgreater}425\%). Results {vWF}:Ag remained unchanged after system exchange. High {vWF}:Ag was associated with systemic endothelial activation of older and obese patients with elevated {SOFA} score, increased norepinephrine and higher requirement of continuous renal replacement therapy without an effect on {MO} runtime and mortality. Including the mechanism of {MO} failure ({COD}, {WGT}), various patient group emerged. {COD}/low {vWF}:Ag summarized younger and less critically ill patients that benefit mainly from {ECMO} by a significant improvement of their inflammatory and coagulation status ({CRP}, D-dimers, fibrinogen) and highest survival rate (91\%). Instead, {WGT}/high {vWF}:Ag presented older and more obese patients with a two-digit {SOFA} score, highest norepinephrine, and aggravated gas transfer. They benefited temporarily from system exchange but with worst survival (33\%). Conclusions {vWF}:Ag levels alone cannot predict early {MO} failure and outcome in {VV} {ECMO} patients. Probably, the mechanism of clotting disorder in combination with the {vWF}:Ag level seems to be essential for clot formation within the {MO}. In addition, {vWF}:Ag levels allows the identification different patient populations In particular, {WGT}/high {vWF}:Ag represented a critically ill population with higher {ECMO}-associated mortality.},

	abstract = {In this review, we discuss common difficulties that clinicians may encounter while managing patients treated with venovenous ({VV}) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}). {ECMO} is an increasingly important tool for managing severe respiratory failure that is refractory to conventional therapies. Its overall goal is to manage respiratory failure-induced hypoxemia and hypercarbia to allow “lung rest” and promote recovery. Typically, by the time {VV}-{ECMO} is initiated, the patient’s pulmonary condition requires conventional ventilator settings that are detrimental to lung recovery or that exceed the remaining functional lung’s ability to maintain acceptable physiological conditions. Standard mechanical ventilation can activate inflammation and worsen the pulmonary damage caused by the underlying disease, leading to ventilator-induced lung injury. In contrast, {VV}-{ECMO} facilitates lung-protective ventilation, decreasing further ventilator-induced lung injury and allowing lung recovery. Such lung-protective ventilation seeks to avoid barotrauma (by monitoring transpulmonary pressure), volutrauma (by reducing excessive tidal volume to promote lung rest), atelectotrauma [by maintaining adequate positive end-expiratory pressure ({PEEP})], and oxygen toxicity (by decreasing ventilator oxygen levels when {PEEP} is adequate). {ECMO} for adult respiratory failure was associated with overall survival of 62\% in 2018, according to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization ({ELSO}) January 2019 registry report. Difficulties that may arise during {VV}-{ECMO} require timely diagnosis and optimal management to achieve the most favorable outcomes. These difficulties include ventilation issues, hypoxemia (especially as related to recirculation or low {ECMO}-flow-to-cardiac-output ratio), sepsis, malfunctioning critical circuit components, lack of clarity regarding optimal hemoglobin levels, hematological/anticoagulation complications, and right ventricular ({RV}) dysfunction. A culture of safety should be emphasized to optimize patient outcomes. A properly functioning team—not only the bedside clinician, but also nurses, perfusionists, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, pharmacists, nutritionists, and other medical specialists and allied health personnel—is vital for therapeutic success.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To determine the characteristics and outcomes of patients prone-positioned during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung {CT} pattern associated with improved respiratory system static compliance after that intervention.
{DESIGN}: Retrospective, single-center study over 8 years.
{SETTINGS}: Twenty-six bed {ICU} in a tertiary center.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: A propensity score-matched analysis compared patients with prone-positioning during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and those without. An increase of the static compliance greater than or equal to 3 {mL}/cm H2O after 16 hours of prone-positioning defined prone-positioning responders. The primary outcome was the time to successful extracorporeal membrane oxygenation weaning within 90 days of postextracorporeal membrane oxygenation start, with death as a competing risk. Among 298 venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-treated adults with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, 64 were prone-positioning extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Although both propensity score-matched groups had similar extracorporeal membrane oxygenation durations, prone-positioning extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients' 90-day probability of being weaned-off extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and alive was higher (0.75 vs 0.54, p = 0.03; subdistribution hazard ratio [95\% {CI}], 1.54 [1.05-2.58]) and 90-day mortality was lower (20\% vs 42\%, p {\textless} 0.01) than that for no prone-positioning extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-related complications were comparable for the two groups. Patients without improved static compliance had higher percentages of nonaerated or poorly aerated ventral and medial-ventral lung regions (p = 0.047).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Prone-positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was safe and effective and was associated with a higher probability of surviving and being weaned-off extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at 90 days. Patients with greater normally aerated lung tissue in the ventral and medial-ventral regions on quantitative lung {CT}-scan performed before prone-positioning are more likely to improve their static compliance after that procedure during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.},

Prone positioning ({PP}) has been shown to improve the outcomes of moderate-to-severe {ARDS} patients. Few studies and no randomized controlled trials have evaluated the effect of {PP} performed in {ECMO} patients.
{METHODS}: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effect of prone positioning for {ARDS} patients receiving {vvECMO} on survival. All authors were contacted to obtain complementary information not mentioned in the original articles. The main objective was to compare 28-day survival in {vvECMO} patients with {PP} to {vvECMO} patients without {PP} (controls).
{RESULTS}: Thirteen studies with a combined population of 1836 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. {PP} was associated with a significant improvement in 28-day survival (503 survivors among 681 patients in the {PP} group [74\%; 95\% {CI} 71-77] vs. 450 survivors among 770 patients in the control group [58\%, 95\% {CI} 55-62]; {RR} 1.31 [95\% {CI} 1.21-1.41]; I2 22\% [95\% {CI} 0-62\%]; P {\textless} 0.0001). Survival was also improved in terms of other endpoints (60-day survival, 90-day survival, {ICU} survival, and hospital survival).

This study was designed to assess both the incidence and severity of {AVWS} in {COVID}-19 patients undergoing {vvECMO}, and the benefit of comprehensive {vWF} analyses.
{DESIGN}: Prospective observational study.
{SETTING}: {ICU} at a tertiary-care center.
{PATIENTS}: Twenty-seven consecutive {COVID}-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) requiring {vvECMO}.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Comprehensive {vWF} analyses (including sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were performed before, during, and after {vvECMO}. In a subgroup of 12 patients with {AVWS}, effectiveness of treatment with desmopressin was assessed. The patients' mean age was 53 years (range, 23-73), 70\% were male, and all had various comorbidities. Following markedly elevated vwf antigen ({vWF}: Ag; mean, 546\% ({SD}, 282]), {vWF} collagen binding capacity (mean, 469\% [{SD}, 271]), {vWF} activity ({vWF}:A; mean, 383\% [{SD}, 132]), and factor {VIII} activity (mean, 302\% [{SD}, 106]), and only borderline decreases in high-molecular-weight ({HMW}) {vWF} multimers before {vvECMO}, all of these variables decreased and {HMW} {vWF} multimers became undetectable within hours following initiation of {vvECMO}. All variables fully recovered within 3-38 hours after discontinuation of {vvECMO}. During {vvECMO}, decreases in the {vWF}:A/{vWF}:Ag ratio correlated with absent {HMW} {vWF} multimers. Desmopressin did not affect {vWF} parameters.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In patients with {COVID}-19-associated {ARDS}, {AVWS} developed soon after initiation of {vvECMO}. The {vWF}:A/{vWF}:Ag ratio was a suitable screening test for {AVWS}. As desmopressin was ineffective, bleeding during {vvECMO}-associated {AVWS} should preferably be treated with concentrates containing {vWF}.},

	abstract = {Previous experience has shown that transporting patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}) is a safe and effective mode of transferring critically ill patients requiring maximum mechanical ventilator support to a quaternary care center. The coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) pandemic posed new challenges. This is a multicenter, retrospective study of 113 patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, cannulated at an outside hospital and transported on {ECMO} to an {ECMO} center. This was performed by a multidisciplinary mobile {ECMO} team consisting of physicians for cannulation, critical care nurses, and an {ECMO} specialist or perfusionist, along with a driver or pilot. Teams practised strict airborne contact precautions with eyewear while caring for the patient and were in standard Personal Protective Equipment. The primary mode of transportation was ground. Ten patients were transported by air. The average distance traveled was 40 miles ({SD} ±56). The average duration of transport was 133 minutes ({SD} ±92). When stratified by mode of transport, the average distance traveled for ground transports was 36 miles ({SD} ±52) and duration was 136 minutes ({SD} ±93). For air, the average distance traveled was 66 miles ({SD} ±82) and duration was 104 minutes ({SD} ±70). There were no instances of transport-related adverse events including pump failures, cannulation complications at outside hospital, or accidental decannulations or dislodgements in transit. There were no instances of the transport team members contracting {COVID}-19 infection within 21 days after transport. By adhering to best practices and {ACE} precautions, patients with {COVID}-19 can be safely cannulated at an outside hospital and transported to a quaternary care center without increased risk to the transport team.},

	abstract = {Mechanical ventilation ({MV}) remains the cornerstone of acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) management. It guarantees sufficient alveolar ventilation, high {FiO}2 concentration, and high positive end-expiratory pressure levels. However, experimental and clinical studies have accumulated, demonstrating that {MV} also contributes to the high mortality observed in patients with {ARDS} by creating ventilator-induced lung injury. Under these circumstances, extracorporeal lung support ({ECLS}) may be beneficial in two distinct clinical settings: to rescue patients from the high risk for death associated with severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or both not responding to maximized conventional {MV}, and to replace {MV} and minimize/abolish the harmful effects of ventilator-induced lung injury. High extracorporeal blood flow venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}) may therefore rescue the sickest patients with {ARDS} from the high risk for death associated with severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or both not responding to maximized conventional {MV}. Successful venovenous {ECMO} treatment in patients with extremely severe H1N1-associated {ARDS} and positive results of the {CESAR} trial have led to an exponential use of the technology in recent years. Alternatively, lower-flow extracorporeal {CO}2 removal devices may be used to reduce the intensity of {MV} (by reducing Vt from 6 to 3-4 ml/kg) and to minimize or even abolish the harmful effects of ventilator-induced lung injury if used as an alternative to conventional {MV} in nonintubated, nonsedated, and spontaneously breathing patients. Although conceptually very attractive, the use of {ECLS} in patients with {ARDS} remains controversial, and high-quality research is needed to further advance our knowledge in the field.},

This {ENG} is equivalent to the area ({PVA}) bounded by the end-systolic and end-diastolic P-V curves and the systolic limb of the P-V loop trajectory in the P-V plane. There was a high correlation (r = 0.89) between {VO}2s documented in the literature and {PVAs} assessed by the author from the accompanying P-V data from both isovolumic and ejecting contractions in 11 hearts. A linear regression analysis yielded an empirical equation: {VO}2 (ml O2/beat) = a . {PVA} ({mmHg} . ml/beat) + b, where a = 1.37 X 10(-5) and b = 0.027, which can be used to predict {VO}2 from {PVA}.

	abstract = {Background
Out of hospital cardiac arrest ({OHCA}) has a poor outcome. Recent non-randomized studies of {ECLS} (extracorporeal life support) in {OHCA} suggested further prospective multicenter studies to define population that would benefit from {ECLS}. We aim to perform a prospective randomized study comparing prehospital intraarrest hypothermia combined with mechanical chest compression device, intrahospital {ECLS} and early invasive investigation and treatment in all patients with {OHCA} of presumed cardiac origin compared to a standard of care.

Methods
This paper describes methodology and design of the proposed trial. Patients with witnessed {OHCA} without {ROSC} (return of spontaneous circulation) after a minimum of 5 minutes of {ACLS} (advanced cardiac life support) by emergency medical service ({EMS}) team and after performance of all initial procedures (defibrillation, airway management, intravenous access establishment) will be randomized to standard vs. hyperinvasive arm. In hyperinvasive arm, mechanical compression device together with intranasal evaporative cooling will be instituted and patients will be transferred directly to cardiac center under ongoing {CPR} (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). After admission, {ECLS} inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated and if achieved, veno-arterial {ECLS} will be started. Invasive investigation and standard post resuscitation care will follow. Patients in standard arm will be managed on scene. When {ROSC} achieved, they will be transferred to cardiac center and further treated as per recent guidelines.

Primary outcome
6 months survival with good neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category 1–2). Secondary outcomes will include 30 day neurological and cardiac recovery.

Discussion
Authors introduce and offer a protocol of a proposed randomized study comparing a combined “hyperinvasive approach” to a standard of care in refractory {OHCA}. The protocol is opened for sharing by other cardiac centers with available {ECLS} and cathlab teams trained to admit patients with refractory cardiac arrest under ongoing {CPR}. A prove of concept study will be started soon. The aim of the authors is to establish a net of centers for a multicenter trial initiation in future.

Ethics and registration
The protocol has been approved by an Institutional Review Board, will be supported by a research grant from Internal Grant Agency of the Ministry of Health, Czech Republic {NT} 13225-4/2012 and has been registered under {ClinicalTrials}.gov identifier: {NCT}01511666.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ({OHCA}) and ventricular fibrillation, more than half present with refractory ventricular fibrillation unresponsive to initial standard advanced cardiac life support ({ACLS}) treatment. We did the first randomised clinical trial in the {USA} of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO})-facilitated resuscitation versus standard {ACLS} treatment in patients with {OHCA} and refractory ventricular fibrillation.
{METHODS}: For this phase 2, single centre, open-label, adaptive, safety and efficacy randomised clinical trial, we included adults aged 18-75 years presenting to the University of Minnesota Medical Center ({MN}, {USA}) with {OHCA} and refractory ventricular fibrillation, no return of spontaneous circulation after three shocks, automated cardiopulmonary resuscitation with a Lund University Cardiac Arrest System, and estimated transfer time shorter than 30 min. Patients were randomly assigned to early {ECMO}-facilitated resuscitation or standard {ACLS} treatment on hospital arrival by use of a secure schedule generated with permuted blocks of randomly varying block sizes. Allocation concealment was achieved by use of a randomisation schedule that required scratching off an opaque layer to reveal assignment. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were safety, survival, and functional assessment at hospital discharge and at 3 months and 6 months after discharge. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. The study qualified for exception from informed consent (21 Code of Federal Regulations 50.24). The {ARREST} trial is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, {NCT}03880565.
{FINDINGS}: Between Aug 8, 2019, and June 14, 2020, 36 patients were assessed for inclusion. After exclusion of six patients, 30 were randomly assigned to standard {ACLS} treatment (n=15) or to early {ECMO}-facilitated resuscitation (n=15). One patient in the {ECMO}-facilitated resuscitation group withdrew from the study before discharge. The mean age was 59 years (range 36-73), and 25 (83\%) of 30 patients were men. Survival to hospital discharge was observed in one (7\%) of 15 patients (95\% credible interval 1·6-30·2) in the standard {ACLS} treatment group versus six (43\%) of 14 patients (21·3-67·7) in the early {ECMO}-facilitated resuscitation group (risk difference 36·2\%, 3·7-59·2; posterior probability of {ECMO} superiority 0·9861). The study was terminated at the first preplanned interim analysis by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute after unanimous recommendation from the Data Safety Monitoring Board after enrolling 30 patients because the posterior probability of {ECMO} superiority exceeded the prespecified monitoring boundary. Cumulative 6-month survival was significantly better in the early {ECMO} group than in the standard {ACLS} group. No unanticipated serious adverse events were observed.
{INTERPRETATION}: Early {ECMO}-facilitated resuscitation for patients with {OHCA} and refractory ventricular fibrillation significantly improved survival to hospital discharge compared with standard {ACLS} treatment.

{METHODS}: We consecutively included refractory {OHCA} patients. In Period 1, {ECPR} was indicated in selected patients after 30min of advanced life support; in- or pre-hospital implementation depended on estimated transportation time and {ECPR} team availability. In Period 2, patient care relied on early {ECPR} initiation after 20min of resuscitation, stringent patient selection, epinephrine dose limitation and deployment of {ECPR} team with initial response team. Primary outcome was survival with good neurological function Cerebral Performance Category score ({CPC} score) 1 and 2 at {ICU} discharge or day 28.
{FINDINGS}: A total of 156 patients were included. (114 in Period 1 and 42 in Period 2). Baseline characteristics were similar. Mean low-flow duration was shorter by 20min (p{\textless}0.001) in Period 2. Survival was significantly higher in Period 2: 29\% vs 8\% (P{\textless}0.001), as confirmed by the multivariate analysis and propensity score. When combining stringent patient selection with an aggressive strategy, the survival rate increased to 38\%. Pre-hospital {ECPR} implementation in itself was not an independent predictor of improved survival, but it was part of the strategy in Period 2.
{INTERPRETATION}: Our data suggest that {ECPR} in specific settings in the management of refractory {OHCA} is feasible and can lead to a significant increase in neurological intact survivors. These data, however, need to be confirmed by a large {RCT}.},

The aim of this study was to demonstrate heterogeneity of {ECMO} use and its association with hospital size and annual frequency in Germany. Methods This is a database analysis of all {ECMO} cases in Germany from 2010 to 2016 using the German Diagnosis Related Groups ({DRG}) coding system for {ECMO}. Results During the study period, 510 hospitals performed 29,929 {ECMO} runs (12,572 {vvECMO}, 11,504 {vaECMO}, 1993 {pECLA}) with an increase over time. Mortality ranged between 58\% and 66\% for {vaECMO} cases and 66\% and 53\% for {vvECMO} cases. 304 (61\%) hospitals performed only one {ECMO} per year. 78\%\% of all {ECMO} runs were performed in centres with more than 20 cases per year and more than half of all {ECMO} runs were performed in hospitals with {\textgreater}1.000 beds. Mortality for vv and {vaECMO} was highest in very small hospitals ({\textless} 200 beds; 70\%; 74\%) and very large hospitals ({\textgreater}1000 beds; 60\%; 62\%). Conclusions Use of {ECMO} is still increasing and a substantial proportion of hospitals performs very few {ECMO} runs. Small hospitals had a significantly higher mortality, but dependence on hospital size and {ECMO} mortality was irregular.},

For example, individuals undergoing treatment for surgically resectable disease may experience recurrence near the removed tumor, metastatic recurrence at other sites, occurrence of second primary cancer, or death resulting from noncancer causes before any of these events. Two quantities, the cause-specific hazard function and the cumulative incidence function, are commonly used to summarize outcomes by event type. Tests for event-specific differences between treatment groups may thus be based on comparison of (a) cause-specific hazards via a log-rank or related test, or (b) the cumulative incidence functions via one of several available tests. Inferential results for tests based on these different metrics can differ considerably for the same cause-specific end point. Depending on the questions of principal interest, one or both metrics may be appropriate to consider. We present simulation study results and discuss examples from cancer clinical trials to illustrate these points and provide guidance for analysis when competing risks are present.},

We conducted a retrospective single-center study of 34 adult {ECMO} patients whose heparin was monitored by anti-Xa and/or {aPTT}.

Major thrombotic and hemorrhagic events occurred in 14.7\% and 26.5\% of patients, respectively.

	abstract = {Left ventricular ({LV}) dilatation is commonly seen with {LV} failure and is often aggravated during venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({VA} {ECMO}). In this context, the intricate interaction between left and right heart function is considered to be of pivotal importance, yet mechanistically not well understood. We hypothesize that a preserved or enhanced right heart contractility causes increased {LV} loading both with and without {VA} {ECMO}. A closed-loop in-silico simulation model containing the cardiac chambers, the pericardium, septal interactions, and the pulmonary and systemic vascular systems with an option to connect a simulated {VA} {ECMO} circuit was developed. Right ventricular contractility was modified during simulation of severe {LV} failure with and without {VA} {ECMO}. Left atrial pressures increased from 14.0 to 23.8 mm Hg without {VA} {ECMO} and from 18.4 to 27.0 mm Hg under {VA} {ECMO} support when right heart contractility was increased between end-systolic elastance 0.1 and 1.0 mm Hg/ml. Left-sided end-diastolic volumes increased from 125 to 169 ml without {VA} {ECMO} and from 150 to 180 ml with {VA} {ECMO}. Simulations demonstrate that increased diastolic loading of the {LV} may be driven by increased right ventricular contractility and that left atrial pressures cannot be interpreted as a reflection of the degree of {LV} dysfunction and overload without considering right ventricular function. Our study illustrates that modelling and computer simulation are important tools to unravel complex cardiovascular mechanisms underlying the right–left heart interdependency both with and without mechanical circulatory support.},

	abstract = {Timing and causes of hospital mortality in adult patients undergoing veno‐arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V‐A {ECMO}) have been poorly described. Aim of the current review was to investigate the timing and causes of death of adult patients supported with V‐A {ECMO} and subsequently define the “V‐A {ECMO} gap,” which represents the patients who are successfully weaned of {ECMO} but eventually die during hospital stay. A systematic search was performed using electronic {MEDLINE} and {EMBASE} databases through {PubMed}. Studies reporting on adult V‐A {ECMO} patients from January 1993 to December 2020 were screened. The studies included in this review were studies that reported more than 10 adult, human patients, and no mechanical circulatory support other than V‐A {ECMO}. Information extracted from each study included mainly mortality and causes of death on {ECMO} and after weaning. Complications and discharge rates were also extracted. Sixty studies with 9181 patients were included for analysis in this systematic review. Overall mortality was 38.0\% (95\% confidence intervals [{CIs}] 34.2\%‐41.9\%) during V‐A {ECMO} support (reported by 60 studies) and 15.3\% (95\% {CI} 11.1\%‐19.5\%, reported by 57 studies) after weaning. Finally, 44.0\% of patients (95\% {CI} 39.8‐52.2) were discharged from hospital (reported by 60 studies). Most common causes of death on {ECMO} were multiple organ failure, followed by cardiac failure and neurological causes. More than one‐third of V‐A {ECMO} patients die during {ECMO} support. Additionally, many of successfully weaned patients still decease during hospital stay, defining the “V‐A {ECMO} gap.” Underreporting and lack of uniformity in reporting of important parameters remains problematic in {ECMO} research. Future studies should uniformly define timing and causes of death in V‐A {ECMO} patients to better understand the effectiveness and complications of this support.},

{DESIGN}: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
{DATA} {SOURCES}: {MEDLINE}/{PubMed} was searched for articles on complications and mortality occurring during or after {ECMO}.
{DATA} {EXTRACTION}: Included studies had more than 100 patients receiving {ECMO} and reported in detail fatal or nonfatal complications occurring during or after {ECMO}. Primary outcome was mortality at the longest follow-up available; secondary outcomes were fatal and non-fatal complications.
{DATA} {SYNTHESIS}: Twelve studies were included (1763 patients), mostly reporting on venoarterial {ECMO}. Criteria for applying {ECMO} were variable, but usually comprised acute respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock or both. After a median follow-up of 30 days (1st-3rd quartile, 30-68 days), overall mortality was 54\% (95\% {CI}, 47\%-61\%), with 45\% (95\% {CI}, 42\%-48\%) of fatal events occurring during {ECMO} and 13\% (95\% {CI}, 11\%-15\%) after it. The most common complications associated with {ECMO} were: renal failure requiring continuous venovenous haemofiltration (occurring in 52\%), bacterial pneumonia (33\%), any bleeding (33\%), oxygenator dysfunction requiring replacement (29\%), sepsis (26\%), haemolysis (18\%), liver dysfunction (16\%), leg ischaemia (10\%), venous thrombosis (10\%), central nervous system complications (8\%), gastrointestinal bleeding (7\%), aspiration pneumonia (5\%), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (5\%).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Even with conditions usually associated with a high chance of death, almost 50\% of patients receiving {ECMO} survive up to discharge. Complications are frequent and most often comprise renal failure, pneumonia or sepsis, and bleeding.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The optimal anticoagulation strategy for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({VV}-{ECMO}) is not known.
{OBJECTIVES}: To evaluate the safety of anticoagulation strategies and monitoring during {VV}-{ECMO} for respiratory failure.
{DATA} {SOURCES}: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the association between anticoagulation strategies during {VV}-{ECMO} and prespecified outcomes, including major bleeding episodes, thrombotic events, and in-hospital mortality. We included articles published between 1977 and January 30, 2015. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scoring system. A separate meta-analysis was not planned.
{DATA} {EXTRACTION}: Data were independently extracted by two authors and collected on a standardized report form.
{SYNTHESIS}: A total of 18 studies (n = 646) were included; 17 studies enrolled patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Across all studies, the duration of {VV}-{ECMO} support ranged from 4 to 20 days. Patients received an average of 2.3 (±3.9) units of transfused red blood cells per day. The bleeding rate across all studies was 16\%, and the rate of thrombosis was 53\%. Among seven studies (199 patients) targeting a specified activated partial thromboplastin time ({aPTT}), there were 37 (19\%) major bleeding episodes and 53 (27\%) major thromboses. Among five studies (43 patients) with {aPTT} targets of 60 seconds or greater, there were 24 (56\%) bleeding episodes and 3 (7\%) clotting events. Three studies (156 patients) with an {aPTT} target under 60 seconds reported 13 (8\%) and 50 (32\%) significant bleeding and thrombotic events, respectively. The most commonly reported thrombotic events were circuit-related clotting and deep-vein thrombosis. Mortality during {VV}-{ECMO} varied across the studies, ranging from 0 to at least 50\% at heterogeneous time points. The total number of deaths for all studies combined was 186 (29\%).
{CONCLUSIONS}: The role and optimal therapeutic targets for anticoagulation during {VV}-{ECMO} are unclear. Previously published studies are limited by retrospective, observational design, small cohorts, and patient heterogeneity. The clinical significance of reported thrombotic complications is largely unknown.

Selection bias in case–control studies occurs when control selection is inappropriate. However, selection bias due to improper case sampling is less well recognized. We describe how to recognize survivor bias (i.e., selection on exposed cases) and illustrate this with an example study.
Study Design and Setting
A case–control study was used to analyze the effect of statins on major bleedings during treatment with vitamin K antagonists. A total of 110 patients who experienced such bleedings were included 18–1,018 days after the bleeding complication and matched to 220 controls.

A protective association of major bleeding for exposure to statins (odds ratio [{OR}]: 0.56; 95\% confidence interval: 0.29–1.08) was found, which did not become stronger after adjustment for confounding factors. These observations lead us to suspect survivor bias. To identify this bias, results were stratified on time between bleeding event and inclusion, and repeated for a negative control (an exposure not related to survival): blood group non-O. The {ORs} for exposure to statins increased gradually to 1.37 with shorter time between outcome and inclusion, whereas {ORs} for the negative control remained constant, confirming our hypothesis.
Conclusion
We recommend the presented method to check for overoptimistic results, that is, survivor bias in case–control studies.},

The sparsity, noise, and high dimensionality of these data present unique challenges. Whilst approaches for integrating single-cell data are emerging and are far from being standardized, most data integration, cell clustering, cell trajectory, and analysis pipelines employ a dimension reduction step, frequently principal component analysis ({PCA}), a matrix factorization method that is relatively fast, and can easily scale to large datasets when used with sparse-matrix representations. In this review, we provide a guide to {PCA} and related methods. We describe the relationship between {PCA} and singular value decomposition, the difference between {PCA} of a correlation and covariance matrix, the impact of scaling, log-transforming, and standardization, and how to recognize a horseshoe or arch effect in a {PCA}. We describe canonical correlation analysis ({CCA}), a popular matrix factorization approach for the integration of single-cell data from different platforms or studies. We discuss alternatives to {CCA} and why additional preprocessing or weighting datasets within the joint decomposition should be considered.},

	abstract = {In the current issue of the European Respiratory Journal , Lee et al. [1] have done excellent work developing and validating a risk equation for incident pulmonary arterial hypertension ({PAH}) patients in the {UK}. In addition, they have very helpfully summarised the differences and similarities between the newly developed Scottish composite score ({SCS}) and other contemporary {PAH} survival equations. One of the most important methodological choices was the decision to include only incident cases in the analysis, and this is an issue which deserves further discussion because of the implications for the design of registries and other observational studies in {PAH}.

Prevalent cohorts are prone to inherent bias. Prevalent cohorts in {PAH}, and in fact for any disease, are subject to a survivor bias because patients who die soon after disease onset are less likely to be included in a prevalent cohort. For instance, consider two different subgroups, one with a mean survival of 4 yrs and another with a mean survival time of 8 yrs. If the incidence rate is constant over time, patients from the latter cohort, with the better prognosis, will be twice as likely as the former group to appear in a prevalent cohort. The latter group will therefore be overrepresented if one is interested in the distribution of an incident cohort. Survivor bias of this nature impacts the development of survival estimates in two distinct ways. First, an analysis cohort consisting of prevalent patients will have a disproportionately higher number of lower risk patients. In {PAH} prevalent cohorts, we see more females, fewer functional class ({FC}) {IV} patients and more patients with longer 6-minute walk distances (6MWDs). Because there are more of these patients, they receive more weight in the development of equations. Second, the future prognosis of this lower risk cohort …},

The first two methods illustrated how survival bias could be introduced. Three additional methods were considered to control for this bias. Methods were compared in the context of evaluating statins for secondary prevention in elderly patients post-acute myocardial infarction who initiated statins within 90 days after discharge and those who did not. Method 1 that classified patients into users and nonusers at discharge resulted in an overestimation of the benefit (38\% relative risk reduction at 1 year). In method 2, following users from the time of the first prescription and nonusers from a randomly selected time between 0 and 90 days attenuated the effect toward the null (10\% relative risk reduction). Method 3 controlled for survival bias by following patients from the end of the 90-day time window; however, it suffered a major loss of statistical efficiency and precision. Method 4 matched prescription time distribution between users and nonusers at cohort entry. Method 5 used a time-dependent variable for treatment initiation. Methods 4 and 5 better controlled for survival bias and yielded similar results, suggesting a 20\% risk reduction of recurrent myocardial infarction or death events.},

Currently, there is a demand for the classification of large amounts of complex data in order to both extract its latent structure represented by exploratory obtained clusters (or groups) and to summarize it. Since the central issue is this extraction and summarization, the focus of cluster analysis research has been to better capture a smaller number of clusters made up of similar data from the larger complex data then has previously been possible. However, if we observe a multiple number of datasets, and we need to obtain a single result from these datasets using cluster analysis, we must obtain clusters of similar data in a dataset while some external information in other datasets is balanced over the clusters. For example, if we consider that there are K workers and n working locations in which each location has a different working load, then we have two kinds of datasets; one is geographical data of n locations and the other is data of working load with respect to n locations. The purpose of the proposed cluster analysis is to obtain K clusters from the geographical dataset of n locations, while working loads of each cluster are homogeneous over the K clusters. In other words, we try to obtain clusters, each of which contains a balance of geographical distance and workload. Therefore, this paper proposes a cluster analysis that obtains homogeneous clusters in which each has similar data. A numerical example is given to show the good performance.},

There are no published reports of the ideal induction agents in these patients. We sought to describe haemodynamic changes associated with induction of anaesthesia using a midazolam (0.1 mg.kg−1), fentanyl (2 μg.kg−1) and rocuronium (1 mg.kg−1) regimen developed using expert opinion, and adherence to the protocol by our pre-hospital teams. We performed a retrospective review of haemodynamic data recorded during induction of anaesthesia in patients following return of spontaneous circulation, over a 30-month period. We analysed the changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate using a repeated-measures design, as well as the rate of new hypotension or hypertension. Sixty-four patients had four consecutive measurements for analysis (one pre-induction and three post-induction). Systolic blood pressure at all three post-induction measurements was significantly lower than the pre-induction value. Heart rate did not differ between any time-points. New episodes of hypotension (systolic pressure {\textless} 90 {mmHg}) occurred in four (6\%) patients at the first measurement post-induction (95\%{CI} 2–15\%) and 10 (16\%) at the third measurement (95\%{CI} 8–27\%).

Adherence to recommended fentanyl and rocuronium doses was high. Overall, systolic blood pressure was reduced following induction of anaesthesia, and systolic pressures {\textless} 90 {mmHg} occurred more often at measurements made later (up to 9 min) after induction. Changes in heart rate, and new hypertension were uncommon.},

Adults with obstructive sleep apnoea ({OSA}) display substantial heart rate changes during sleep, associated with obstructive respiratory events 1, 2. These heart rate changes are significantly attenuated or abolished with effective continuous positive airway pressure ({CPAP}) treatment 3.

Heart rate variability ({HRV}) refers to the regulation of the sinoatrial node by the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. Evaluation of autonomic heart rate control by means of {HRV} measures has been widely accepted as an important source of information on cardiovascular function 4, 5. {HRV} is important because it provides a window to observe the heart's ability to respond to normal or abnormal regulatory impulses that affect its rate and rhythm.

Several sophisticated methodologies were developed for measuring {HRV}, notably those using the heart rate power spectrum and nonlinear dynamics analysis 6. However, based on the literature, no simple methodology is available for comprehensive use in daily medical practice.

However, a Poincaré or Lorenz plot is a simple semi-quantitative method for visualising and calculating {HRV} 7–10. It has been previously shown that the length and width of a Poincaré plot are a weighted combination of low- and high-frequency powers, so it provides a theoretical link between …},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Trials of potential new therapies in acute lung injury are difficult and expensive to conduct. This article is designed to determine the utility, behavior, and statistical properties of a new primary end point for such trials, ventilator-free days, defined as days alive and free from mechanical ventilation. Describing the nuances of this outcome measure is particularly important because using it, while ignoring mortality, could result in misleading conclusions.
{DESIGN}: To develop a model for the duration of ventilation and mortality and fit the model by using data from a recently completed clinical trial. To determine the appropriate test statistic for the new measure and derive a formula for power. To determine a formula for the probability that the test statistic will reject the null hypothesis and mortality will simultaneously show improvement. To plot power curves for the test statistic and determine sample sizes for reasonable alternative hypotheses.
{SETTING}: Intensive care units.
{PATIENTS}: Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome or acute lung injury as defined by the American-European Consensus Conference.
{MAIN} {RESULTS}: The proposed model fit the clinical data. Ventilator-free days were improved by lower tidal volume ventilation, but the improvement was mostly caused by the improved mortality rate, so trials that expected similar effects would only have modest increase in power if they used ventilator-free days as their primary end point rather than 28-day mortality. Similar results were obtained using the model in two groups segregated by low or high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score. On the other hand, if patients are divided into two groups on the basis of the lung injury score, both the duration of ventilation and mortality are lower in the low lung injury score group. A trial of a treatment that had a similar clinical effect would have a large increase in power, allowing for a reduction in the required sample size.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Use of ventilator-free days as a trial end point allows smaller sample sizes if it is assumed that the treatment being tested simultaneously reduces the duration of ventilation and improves mortality. It is unlikely that a treatment that led to higher mortality could lead to a statistically significant improvement in ventilator-free days. This would be especially true if the treatment were also required to produce a nominal improvement in mortality.},

Our aim was to evaluate the heterogeneity of treatment effect on 60-day mortality from an early vs a delayed strategy across levels of risk for renal replacement therapy initiation under a delayed strategy.
{METHODS}: We used data from the {AKIKI}, and {IDEAL}-{ICU} randomized controlled trials to develop a multivariable logistic regression model for renal replacement therapy initiation within 48 h after allocation to a delayed strategy. We then used an interaction with spline terms in a Cox model to estimate treatment effects across the predicted risks of {RRT} initiation.
{RESULTS}: We analyzed data from 1107 patients (619 and 488 in the {AKIKI} and {IDEAL}-{ICU} trial respectively). In the pooled sample, we found evidence for heterogeneous treatment effects (P = 0.023). Patients at an intermediate-high risk of renal replacement therapy initiation within 48 h may have benefited from an early strategy (absolute risk difference, - 14\%; 95\% confidence interval, - 27\% to - 1\%). For other patients, we found no evidence of benefit from an early strategy of renal replacement therapy initiation but a trend for harm (absolute risk difference, 8\%; 95\% confidence interval, - 5\% to 21\% in patients at intermediate-low risk).
{CONCLUSIONS}: We have identified a clinically sound heterogeneity of treatment effect of an early vs a delayed strategy of renal replacement therapy initiation that may reflect varying degrees of kidney demand-capacity mismatch.},

        The derived hourly urine output ({UO}) indexed by body weight is one of the major criteria for the diagnosis of acute kidney injury ({AKI}). However, it is unclear whether actual body weight ({ABW}) or ideal body weight ({IBW}) should be used. This study aims to explore whether {UO} calculation based on {ABW} might lead to overestimation of {AKI}.
        Method: 
        {AKI} patients identified in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care {III} database by different components of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines and different definitions of body weight were retrospectively studied. Hospital and 90-day mortality were compared to decide whether different patient groups had the same outcome.
        Results: 
        In the cohort of 14,725 patients, {AKI} was identified in 4,298 (29.19\%) and 3,060 (20.78\%) patients respectively when {ABW} or {IBW} was used (P {\textless} 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that {AKI} patients identified by {UO} calculated from {ABW} had similar hospital and 90-day mortality to that of patients with no evidence of {AKI}. Whereas {AKI} patients identified by serum creatinine changes, or those identified by both {ABW} and {IBW}, had twice higher the risks of hospital death and about 1.5 times higher the risks of 90-day death compared with thoese with no evidence of {AKI}. Results were confirmed in two separate sensitivity analyses where patients whose admission creatinine levels were within the normal reference ranges and patients identified as sepsis were studied.
        Conclusions: 
        Calculating hourly body weight normalized {UO} using {ABW} may lead to underestimation of {UO} and overestimation of {AKI}.},

	shorttitle = {Longitudinal respiratory subphenotypes in patients with {COVID}-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome},
	abstract = {Background
Patients with {COVID}-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) have been postulated to present with distinct respiratory subphenotypes. However, most phenotyping schema have been limited by sample size, disregard for temporal dynamics, and insufficient validation. We aimed to identify respiratory subphenotypes of {COVID}-19-related {ARDS} using unbiased data-driven approaches.

Methods
{PRoVENT}–{COVID} was an investigator-initiated, national, multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study at 22 intensive care units ({ICUs}) in the Netherlands. Consecutive patients who had received invasive mechanical ventilation for {COVID}-19 (aged 18 years or older) served as the derivation cohort, and similar patients from two {ICUs} in the {USA} served as the replication cohorts. {COVID}-19 was confirmed by positive {RT}-{PCR}. We used latent class analysis to identify subphenotypes using clinically available respiratory data cross-sectionally at baseline, and longitudinally using 8-hourly data from the first 4 days of invasive ventilation. We used group-based trajectory modelling to evaluate trajectories of individual variables and to facilitate potential clinical translation. The {PRoVENT}-{COVID} study is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, {NCT}04346342.

Findings
Between March 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, 1007 patients were admitted to participating {ICUs} in the Netherlands, and included in the derivation cohort. Data for 288 patients were included in replication cohort 1 and 326 in replication cohort 2. Cross-sectional latent class analysis did not identify any underlying subphenotypes. Longitudinal latent class analysis identified two distinct subphenotypes. Subphenotype 2 was characterised by higher mechanical power, minute ventilation, and ventilatory ratio over the first 4 days of invasive mechanical ventilation than subphenotype 1, but {PaO}2/{FiO}2, {pH}, and compliance of the respiratory system did not differ between the two subphenotypes. 185 (28\%) of 671 patients with subphenotype 1 and 109 (32\%) of 336 patients with subphenotype 2 had died at day 28 (p=0·10). However, patients with subphenotype 2 had fewer ventilator-free days at day 28 (median 0, {IQR} 0–15 vs 5, 0–17; p=0·016) and more frequent venous thrombotic events (109 [32\%] of 336 patients vs 176 [26\%] of 671 patients; p=0·048) compared with subphenotype 1. Group-based trajectory modelling revealed trajectories of ventilatory ratio and mechanical power with similar dynamics to those observed in latent class analysis-derived trajectory subphenotypes. The two trajectories were: a stable value for ventilatory ratio or mechanical power over the first 4 days of invasive mechanical ventilation (trajectory A) or an upward trajectory (trajectory B). However, upward trajectories were better independent prognosticators for 28-day mortality ({OR} 1·64, 95\% {CI} 1·17–2·29 for ventilatory ratio; 1·82, 1·24–2·66 for mechanical power). The association between upward ventilatory ratio trajectories (trajectory B) and 28-day mortality was confirmed in the replication cohorts ({OR} 4·65, 95\% {CI} 1·87–11·6 for ventilatory ratio in replication cohort 1; 1·89, 1·05–3·37 for ventilatory ratio in replication cohort 2).

Interpretation
At baseline, {COVID}-19-related {ARDS} has no consistent respiratory subphenotype. Patients diverged from a fairly homogenous to a more heterogeneous population, with trajectories of ventilatory ratio and mechanical power being the most discriminatory. Modelling these parameters alone provided prognostic value for duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality.

	abstract = {Rationale
              Using latent class analysis ({LCA}), two subphenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) have consistently been identified in five randomised controlled trials ({RCTs}), with distinct biological characteristics, divergent outcomes and differential treatment responses to randomised interventions. Their existence in unselected populations of {ARDS} remains unknown. We sought to identify subphenotypes in observational cohorts of {ARDS} using {LCA}.
            
            
              Methods
              {LCA} was independently applied to patients with {ARDS} from two prospective observational cohorts of patients admitted to the intensive care unit, derived from the Validating Acute Lung Injury markers for Diagnosis ({VALID}) (n=624) and Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury ({EARLI}) (n=335) studies. Clinical and biological data were used as class-defining variables. To test for concordance with prior {ARDS} subphenotypes, the performance metrics of parsimonious classifier models (interleukin 8, bicarbonate, protein C and vasopressor-use), previously developed in {RCTs}, were evaluated in {EARLI} and {VALID} with {LCA}-derived subphenotypes as the gold-standard.
            
            
              Results
              A 2-class model best fit the population in {VALID} (p=0.0010) and in {EARLI} (p{\textless}0.0001). Class 2 comprised 27\% and 37\% of the populations in {VALID} and {EARLI}, respectively. Consistent with the previously described ‘hyperinflammatory’ subphenotype, Class 2 was characterised by higher proinflammatory biomarkers, acidosis and increased shock and worse clinical outcomes. The similarities between these and prior {RCT}-derived subphenotypes were further substantiated by the performance of the parsimonious classifier models in both cohorts (area under the curves 0.92–0.94). The hyperinflammatory subphenotype was associated with increased prevalence of chronic liver disease and neutropenia and reduced incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Measurement of novel biomarkers showed significantly higher levels of matrix metalloproteinase-8 and markers of endothelial injury in the hyperinflammatory subphenotype, whereas, matrix metalloproteinase-9 was significantly lower.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Previously described subphenotypes are generalisable to unselected populations of non-trauma {ARDS}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A life-threatening complication of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) is acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) refractory to conventional management. Venovenous ({VV}) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}) ({VV}-{ECMO}) is used to support patients with {ARDS} in whom conventional management fails. Scoring systems to predict mortality in {VV}-{ECMO} remain unvalidated in {COVID}-19 {ARDS}. This report describes a large single-center experience with {VV}-{ECMO} in {COVID}-19 and assesses the utility of standard risk calculators.
{METHODS}: A retrospective review of a prospective database of all patients with {COVID}-19 who underwent {VV}-{ECMO} cannulation between March 15 and June 27, 2020 at a single academic center was performed. Demographic, clinical, and {ECMO} characteristics were collected. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; survivor and nonsurvivor cohorts were compared by using univariate and bivariate analyses.
{RESULTS}: Forty patients who had {COVID}-19 and underwent {ECMO} were identified. Of the 33 patients (82.5\%) in whom {ECMO} had been discontinued at the time of analysis, 18 patients (54.5\%) survived to hospital discharge, and 15 (45.5\%) died during {ECMO}. Nonsurvivors presented with a statistically significant higher Prediction of Survival on {ECMO} Therapy ({PRESET})-Score (mean ± {SD}, 8.33 ± 0.8 vs 6.17 ± 1.8; P = .001). The {PRESET} score demonstrated accurate mortality prediction. All patients with a {PRESET}-Score of 6 or lowers survived, and a score of 7 or higher was associated with a dramatic increase in mortality.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These results suggest that favorable outcomes are possible in patients with {COVID}-19 who undergo {ECMO} at high-volume centers. This study demonstrated an association between the {PRESET}-Score and survival in patients with {COVID}-19 who underwent {VV}-{ECMO}. Standard risk calculators may aid in appropriate selection of patients with {COVID}-19 {ARDS} for {ECMO}.},

	abstract = {Interest in the use of mechanical circulatory support for patients presenting with cardiogenic shock is growing rapidly. The Impella (Abiomed Inc), a microaxial, continuous-flow, short-term, ventricular assist device ({VAD}), requires meticulous postimplantation management. Because systemic anticoagulation is needed to prevent pump thrombosis, patients are exposed to increased bleeding risk, further aggravated by sepsis, thrombocytopenia, and high shear stress-induced acquired von Willebrand syndrome. The precarious balance between bleeding and thrombosis in percutaneous {VAD}-supported cardiogenic shock patients is often the main reason that patient outcomes are jeopardized, and there is a lack of data addressing optimal anticoagulation management strategies during percutaneous {VAD} support. Here, we present a parallel anti-Factor Xa/activated partial thromboplastin time-guided anticoagulation algorithm and discuss pitfalls of heparin monitoring in critically ill patients. This review will guide physicians toward a more standardized (anti)coagulation approach to tackle device-related morbidity and mortality in this critically ill patient group.},

More recently, many alternative approaches to address these two challenges have been proposed, but knowledge of their properties and meaningful comparisons between them are scarce. To define a state of the art and to provide evidence-supported guidance to researchers who have only a basic level of statistical knowledge, many outstanding issues in multivariable modelling remain.

        To update the 2008 consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency ({CIRCI}) in adult and pediatric patients.
        Participants: 
        A multispecialty task force of 16 international experts in critical care medicine, endocrinology, and guideline methods, all of them members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and/or the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine.
        Design/Methods: 
        The recommendations were based on the summarized evidence from the 2008 document in addition to more recent findings from an updated systematic review of relevant studies from 2008 to 2017 and were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation ({GRADE}) methodology. The strength of each recommendation was classified as strong or conditional, and the quality of evidence was rated from high to very low based on factors including the individual study design, the risk of bias, the consistency of the results, and the directness and precision of the evidence. Recommendation approval required the agreement of at least 80\% of the task force members.
        Results: 
        The task force was unable to reach agreement on a single test that can reliably diagnose {CIRCI}, although delta cortisol (change in baseline cortisol at 60 min of {\textless} 9 μg/{dL}) after cosyntropin (250 μg) administration and a random plasma cortisol of {\textless} 10 μg/{dL} may be used by clinicians. We suggest against using plasma-free cortisol or salivary cortisol level over plasma total cortisol (conditional, very low quality of evidence). For treatment of specific conditions, we suggest using {IV} hydrocortisone {\textless} 400 mg/day for ≥ 3 days at full dose in patients with septic shock that is not responsive to fluid and moderate- to high-dose vasopressor therapy (conditional, low quality of evidence). We suggest not using corticosteroids in adult patients with sepsis without shock (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest the use of {IV} methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day in patients with early moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ({PaO}2/{FiO}2 {\textless} 200 and within 14 days of onset) (conditional, moderate quality of evidence). Corticosteroids are not suggested for patients with major trauma (conditional, low quality of evidence).
        Conclusions: 
        Evidence-based recommendations for the use of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with sepsis and septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and major trauma have been developed by a multispecialty task force.},

{OBJECTIVES}: To evaluate intensive care unit ({ICU}) incidence and outcome of {ARDS} and to assess clinician recognition, ventilation management, and use of adjuncts-for example prone positioning-in routine clinical practice for patients fulfilling the {ARDS} Berlin Definition.
{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: The Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure ({LUNG} {SAFE}) was an international, multicenter, prospective cohort study of patients undergoing invasive or noninvasive ventilation, conducted during 4 consecutive weeks in the winter of 2014 in a convenience sample of 459 {ICUs} from 50 countries across 5 continents.
{EXPOSURES}: Acute respiratory distress syndrome.
{MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: The primary outcome was {ICU} incidence of {ARDS}. Secondary outcomes included assessment of clinician recognition of {ARDS}, the application of ventilatory management, the use of adjunctive interventions in routine clinical practice, and clinical outcomes from {ARDS}.
{RESULTS}: Of 29,144 patients admitted to participating {ICUs}, 3022 (10.4\%) fulfilled {ARDS} criteria. Of these, 2377 patients developed {ARDS} in the first 48 hours and whose respiratory failure was managed with invasive mechanical ventilation. The period prevalence of mild {ARDS} was 30.0\% (95\% {CI}, 28.2\%-31.9\%); of moderate {ARDS}, 46.6\% (95\% {CI}, 44.5\%-48.6\%); and of severe {ARDS}, 23.4\% (95\% {CI}, 21.7\%-25.2\%). {ARDS} represented 0.42 cases per {ICU} bed over 4 weeks and represented 10.4\% (95\% {CI}, 10.0\%-10.7\%) of {ICU} admissions and 23.4\% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Clinical recognition of {ARDS} ranged from 51.3\% (95\% {CI}, 47.5\%-55.0\%) in mild to 78.5\% (95\% {CI}, 74.8\%-81.8\%) in severe {ARDS}. Less than two-thirds of patients with {ARDS} received a tidal volume 8 of {mL}/kg or less of predicted body weight. Plateau pressure was measured in 40.1\% (95\% {CI}, 38.2-42.1), whereas 82.6\% (95\% {CI}, 81.0\%-84.1\%) received a positive end-expository pressure ({PEEP}) of less than 12 cm H2O. Prone positioning was used in 16.3\% (95\% {CI}, 13.7\%-19.2\%) of patients with severe {ARDS}. Clinician recognition of {ARDS} was associated with higher {PEEP}, greater use of neuromuscular blockade, and prone positioning. Hospital mortality was 34.9\% (95\% {CI}, 31.4\%-38.5\%) for those with mild, 40.3\% (95\% {CI}, 37.4\%-43.3\%) for those with moderate, and 46.1\% (95\% {CI}, 41.9\%-50.4\%) for those with severe {ARDS}.
{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: Among {ICUs} in 50 countries, the period prevalence of {ARDS} was 10.4\% of {ICU} admissions. This syndrome appeared to be underrecognized and undertreated and associated with a high mortality rate. These findings indicate the potential for improvement in the management of patients with {ARDS}.

The identified studies were reviewed and information regarding role of corticosteroids in prevention and treatment of {ARDS} was evaluated. Nine trials have evaluated the role of corticosteroid drugs in management of {ARDS} at various stages. Of the 9, 4 trials evaluated role of corticosteroids in prevention of {ARDS}, while other 5 trials were focused on treatment after variable periods of onset of {ARDS}. Trials with preventive corticosteroids, mostly using high doses of {MP}, showed negative results with patients in treatment arm, showing higher mortality and rate of {ARDS} development. While trials of corticosteroids in early {ARDS} showed variable results, somewhat, favoring use of these agents to reduce associated morbidities. In late stage of {ARDS}, these drugs have no benefits and are associated with adverse outcome. Use of corticosteroids in patients with early {ARDS} showed equivocal results in decreasing mortality; however, there is evidence that these drugs reduce organ dysfunction score, lung injury score, ventilator requirement, and intensive care unit stay. However, most of these trials are small, having a significant heterogeneity regarding study design, etiology of {ARDS}, and dosage of corticosteroids. Further research involving large-scale trials on relatively homogeneous cohort is necessary to establish the role of corticosteroids for this condition.},

Randomized controlled trials of steroids for {ARDS} have answered some, but not all, questions regarding efficacy for prevention and treatment. First, there is no evidence that corticosteroids prevent the development of {ARDS} among patients at risk. Second, high dose and short course treatment with steroids does not improve the outcomes of patients with {ARDS}.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) pandemic progresses, more literature supporting the use of corticosteroids for {COVID}-19 and non-{COVID}-19 {ARDS} have emerged. Glucocorticoids are proposed to attenuate the inflammatory response and prevent progression to the fibroproliferative phase of {ARDS} through their multiple mechanisms and anti-inflammatory properties. The purpose of this systematic review was to comprehensively evaluate the literature surrounding corticosteroid use in {ARDS} (non-{COVID}-19 and {COVID}-19) in addition to a narrative review of clinical considerations of corticosteroid use in these patient populations. {OVID} Medline and {EMBASE} were searched. Randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of corticosteroids for {COVID}-19 and non-{COVID}-19 {ARDS} in adult patients on mortality outcomes were included. Risk of bias was assessed with the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. There were 388 studies identified, 15 of which met the inclusion criteria that included a total of 8877 patients. The studies included in our review reported a mortality benefit in 6/15 (40\%) studies with benefit being seen at varying time points of mortality follow-up ({ICU} survival, hospital, and 28 and 60 days) in the {COVID}-19 and non-{COVID}-19 {ARDS} studies. The two non-{COVID}19 trials assessing lung injury score improvements found that corticosteroids led to significant improvements with corticosteroid use. The number of mechanical ventilation-free days significantly were found to be increased with the use of corticosteroids in all four studies that assessed this outcome. Corticosteroids are associated with improvements in mortality and ventilator-free days in critically ill patients with both {COVID}-19 and non-{COVID}-19 {ARDS}, and evidence suggests their use should be encouraged in these settings. However, due to substantial differences in the corticosteroid regimens utilized in these trials, questions still remain regarding the optimal corticosteroid agent, dose, and duration in patients with {ARDS}.},

Background, Mortality in acute respiratory failure remains high despite the use of lung-protective ventilation. Recent studies have shown an association between baseline ventilation parameters (driving pressure or mechanical power) and outcomes for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Strategies focused on limiting these parameters have been proposed to further improve outcomes. However, it remains unknown whether driving pressure and mechanical power should be limited over the entire duration of mechanical ventilation and in all patients with acute respiratory failure. We aimed to estimate the association between exposure to different intensities of mechanical ventilation over time and intensive care unit ({ICU}) mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure.

Methods
In this registry-based, prospective cohort study, we obtained data from the Toronto Intensive Care Observational Registry, which includes all patients receiving mechanical ventilation for 4 h or more in nine {ICUs} that are affiliated with the University of Toronto (Toronto, {ON}, Canada). We included all adult (≥18 years) patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation between April 11, 2014, and June 5, 2019. Patients were excluded if they received treatment with extracorporeal life support. The primary outcome was {ICU} mortality. Bayesian joint models were used to estimate the strength of associations, accounting for informative censoring due to death during follow-up.

Findings
Of 13 939 patients recorded in the registry, 13 408 (96·2\%) were eligible for descriptive analysis. The primary analysis comprised 7876 (58·7\%) patients with complete baseline characteristics, and a secondary analysis included all 13 408 patients after multiple imputation in the joint model analysis. 2409 (18·0\%) of 13 408 patients died in the {ICU}. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, including age and severity of illness, a significant increase in the hazard of death was found to be associated with each daily increment in driving pressure (hazard ratio 1·064, 95\% credible interval 1·057–1·071) or mechanical power (hazard ratio 1·060, 95\% credible interval 1·053–1·066). These associations persisted over the duration of mechanical ventilation.

Interpretation
Cumulative exposure to higher intensities of mechanical ventilation was harmful, even for short durations. Limiting exposure to driving pressure or mechanical power should be evaluated in further studies as promising ventilation strategies to reduce mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure.

	abstract = {Acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) is a devastating critical illness that can be triggered by a wide range of insults and remains associated with a high mortality of around 40\%. The search for targeted treatment for {ARDS} has been disappointing, possibly due to the enormous heterogeneity within the syndrome. In this perspective from the European Respiratory Society research seminar on “Precision medicine in {ARDS}”, we will summarise the current evidence for heterogeneity, explore the evidence in favour of precision medicine and provide a roadmap for further research in {ARDS}. There is evident variation in the presentation of {ARDS} on three distinct levels: 1) aetiological; 2) physiological and 3) biological, which leads us to the conclusion that there is no typical {ARDS}. The lack of a common presentation implies that intervention studies in patients with {ARDS} need to be phenotype aware and apply a precision medicine approach in order to avoid the lack of success in therapeutic trials that we faced in recent decades. Deeper phenotyping and integrative analysis of the sources of variation might result in identification of additional treatable traits that represent specific pathobiological mechanisms, or so-called endotypes.},

Objectives: To identify clinically relevant, novel subgroups in {COVID}-19-related {ARDS} and compare them with previously described {ARDS} subphenotypes. Methods: Eligible participants were adults with {COVID}-19 and {ARDS} at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Latent class analysis was used to identify subgroups with baseline clinical, respiratory, and laboratory data serving as partitioning variables. A previously developed machine learning model was used to classify patients as the hypoinflammatory and hyperinflammatory subphenotypes. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between subgroups. Heterogeneity of treatment effect for corticosteroid use in subgroups was tested. Measurements and Main Results: From March 2, 2020, to April 30, 2020, 483 patients with {COVID}-19-related {ARDS} met study criteria. A two-class latent class analysis model best fit the population (P = 0.0075). Class 2 (23\%) had higher proinflammatory markers, troponin, creatinine, and lactate, lower bicarbonate, and lower blood pressure than class 1 (77\%). Ninety-day mortality was higher in class 2 versus class 1 (75\% vs. 48\%; P {\textless} 0.0001). Considerable overlap was observed between these subgroups and {ARDS} subphenotypes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) {RT}-{PCR} cycle threshold was associated with mortality in the hypoinflammatory but not the hyperinflammatory phenotype. Heterogeneity of treatment effect to corticosteroids was observed (P = 0.0295), with improved mortality in the hyperinflammatory phenotype and worse mortality in the hypoinflammatory phenotype, with the caveat that corticosteroid treatment was not randomized. Conclusions: We identified two {COVID}-19-related {ARDS} subgroups with differential outcomes, similar to previously described {ARDS} subphenotypes. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {PCR} cycle threshold had differential value for predicting mortality in the subphenotypes. The subphenotypes had differential treatment responses to corticosteroids.},

	abstract = {Corticosteroids are key regulators of whole-body homeostasis that provide an organism with the capacity to resist environmental changes and invasion of foreign substances. The effects of corticosteroids are widespread, including profound alterations in carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism, and the modulation of electrolyte and water balance. Corticosteroids affect all of the major systems of the body, including the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, nervous, and immune systems, and play critical roles in fetal development including the maturation of the fetal lung. Because so many systems are sensitive to corticosteroid levels, tight regulatory control is exerted on the system. The direct effects of corticosteroids are sometimes difficult to separate from their complex relationship with other hormones, in part due to the permissive action of low levels of corticosteroid on the effectiveness of other hormones, including catecholamines and glucagon. Nevertheless, the effects of corticosteroids can be classified into two general categories: glucocorticoid (intermediary metabolism, inflammation, immunity, wound healing, myocardial, and muscle integrity) and mineralocorticoid (salt, water, and mineral metabolism). Although the following section discusses the separate effects of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, it must be emphasized that natural steroids possess both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity to some extent. The ratio between the two activities ranges from all glucocorticoid and almost no mineralocorticoid activity (cortisol) to all mineralocorticoid and almost no glucocorticoid activity (aldosterone).},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Mounting evidence has shown that critically ill patients are commonly thiamine deficient. We sought to test the hypothesis that critically ill patients with septic shock exposed to thiamine would demonstrate improved lactate clearance and more favorable clinical outcomes compared with those not receiving thiamine.
{DESIGN}: Retrospective, single-center, matched cohort study.
{SETTING}: Tertiary care academic medical center.
{PATIENTS}: Adult patients admitted with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, or International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition, diagnosis code of septic shock to either the medicine or surgery {ICU}.
{INTERVENTIONS}: None.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Patients who received {IV} thiamine supplementation within 24 hours of hospital admission were identified and compared with a matched cohort of patients not receiving thiamine. The primary objective was to determine if thiamine administration was associated with a reduced time to lactate clearance in septic shock. Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality, acute kidney injury, and need for renal replacement therapy, and vasopressor and mechanical ventilation-free days. Two-thousand two-hundred seventy-two patients were screened, of whom 1,049 were eligible. The study consisted of 123 thiamine-treated patients matched with 246 patients who did not receive thiamine. Based on the Fine-Gray survival model, treatment with thiamine was associated with an improved likelihood of lactate clearance (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.307; 95\% {CI}, 1.002-1.704). Thiamine administration was also associated with a reduction in 28-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.666; 95\% {CI}, 0.490-0.905). There were no differences in any secondary outcomes.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Thiamine administration within 24 hours of admission in patients presenting with septic shock was associated with improved lactate clearance and a reduction in 28-day mortality compared with matched controls.},

	doi = {10.1097/ALN.0000000000004042},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The relationship between the diaphragm thickening fraction and the transdiaphragmatic pressure, the reference method to evaluate the diaphragm function, has not been clearly established. This study investigated the global and intraindividual relationship between the thickening fraction of the diaphragm and the transdiaphragmatic pressure. The authors hypothesized that the diaphragm thickening fraction would be positively and significantly correlated to the transdiaphragmatic pressure, in both healthy participants and ventilated patients.
{METHODS}: Fourteen healthy individuals and 25 mechanically ventilated patients (enrolled in two previous physiologic investigations) participated in the current study. The zone of apposition of the right hemidiaphragm was imaged simultaneously to transdiaphragmatic pressure recording within different breathing conditions, i.e., external inspiratory threshold loading in healthy individuals and various pressure support settings in patients. A blinded offline breath-by-breath analysis synchronously computed the changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure, the diaphragm pressure-time product, and diaphragm thickening fraction. Global and intraindividual relationships between variables were assessed.
{RESULTS}: In healthy subjects, both changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure and diaphragm pressure-time product were moderately correlated to diaphragm thickening fraction (repeated measures correlation = 0.40, P {\textless} 0.0001; and repeated measures correlation = 0.38, P {\textless} 0.0001, respectively). In mechanically ventilated patients, changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure and thickening fraction were weakly correlated (repeated measures correlation = 0.11, P = 0.008), while diaphragm pressure-time product and thickening fraction were not (repeated measures correlation = 0.04, P = 0.396). Individually, changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure and thickening fraction were significantly correlated in 8 of 14 healthy subjects (ρ = 0.30 to 0.85, all P {\textless} 0.05) and in 2 of 25 mechanically ventilated patients (ρ = 0.47 to 0.64, all P {\textless} 0.05). Diaphragm pressure-time product and thickening fraction correlated in 8 of 14 healthy subjects (ρ = 0.41 to 0.82, all P {\textless} 0.02) and in 2 of 25 mechanically ventilated patients (ρ = 0.63 to 0.66, all P {\textless} 0.01).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Overall, diaphragm function as assessed with transdiaphragmatic pressure was weakly related to diaphragm thickening fraction. The diaphragm thickening fraction should not be used in healthy subjects or ventilated patients when changes in diaphragm function are evaluated.

Currently, computed tomography ({CT}) is commonly used for classifying and prognosticating {ARDS}. However, performing this examination in critically ill patients is complex, due to the need to transfer these patients to the {CT} room. Fortunately, new technologies have been developed that allow the monitoring of patients at the bedside. Electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) is a monitoring tool that allows one to evaluate at the bedside the distribution of pulmonary ventilation continuously, in real time, and which has proven to be useful in optimizing mechanical ventilation parameters in critically ill patients. Several clinical applications of {EIT} have been developed during the last years and the technique has been generating increasing interest among researchers. However, among clinicians, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the technical principles of {EIT} and potential applications in {ARDS} patients. The aim of this review is to present the characteristics, technical concepts, and clinical applications of {EIT}, which may allow better monitoring of lung function during {ARDS}.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The incidence, pathophysiology, and consequences of patient-ventilator asynchrony are poorly known. We assessed the incidence of patient-ventilator asynchrony during assisted mechanical ventilation and we identified associated factors.
{METHODS}: Sixty-two consecutive patients requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h were included prospectively as soon as they triggered all ventilator breaths: assist-control ventilation ({ACV}) in 11 and pressure-support ventilation ({PSV}) in 51.
{MEASUREMENTS}: Gross asynchrony detected visually on 30-min recordings of flow and airway pressure was quantified using an asynchrony index.
{RESULTS}: Fifteen patients (24\%) had an asynchrony index greater than 10\% of respiratory efforts. Ineffective triggering and double-triggering were the two main asynchrony patterns. Asynchrony existed during both {ACV} and {PSV}, with a median number of episodes per patient of 72 (range 13-215) vs. 16 (4-47) in 30 min, respectively (p=0.04). Double-triggering was more common during {ACV} than during {PSV}, but no difference was found for ineffective triggering. Ineffective triggering was associated with a less sensitive inspiratory trigger, higher level of pressure support (15 {cmH}(2)O, {IQR} 12-16, vs. 17.5, {IQR} 16-20), higher tidal volume, and higher {pH}. A high incidence of asynchrony was also associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (7.5 days, {IQR} 3-20, vs. 25.5, {IQR} 9.5-42.5).
{CONCLUSIONS}: One-fourth of patients exhibit a high incidence of asynchrony during assisted ventilation. Such a high incidence is associated with a prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation. Patients with frequent ineffective triggering may receive excessive levels of ventilatory support.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: No single pulmonary-specific variable, including the severity of hypoxemia, has been found to predict the risk of death independently when measured early in the course of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Because an increase in the pulmonary dead-space fraction has been described in observational studies of the syndrome, we systematically measured the dead-space fraction early in the course of the illness and evaluated its potential association with the risk of death.
{METHODS}: The dead-space fraction was prospectively measured in 179 intubated patients, a mean (+/-{SD}) of 10.9+/-7.4 hours after the acute respiratory distress syndrome had developed. Additional clinical and physiological variables were analyzed with the use of multiple logistic regression. The study outcome was mortality before hospital discharge.
{RESULTS}: The mean dead-space fraction was markedly elevated (0.58+/-0.09) early in the course of the acute respiratory distress syndrome and was higher among patients who died than among those who survived (0.63+/-0.10 vs. 0.54+/-0.09, P{\textless}0.001). The dead-space fraction was an independent risk factor for death: for every 0.05 increase, the odds of death increased by 45 percent (odds ratio, 1.45; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.15 to 1.83; P=0.002). The only other independent predictors of an increased risk of death were the Simplified Acute Physiology Score {II}, an indicator of the severity of illness (odds ratio, 1.06; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.08; P{\textless}0.001) and quasistatic respiratory compliance (odds ratio, 1.06; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.10; P=0.01).

A major concern in mechanically ventilated patients is the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury, which is partially prevented by lung-protective ventilation. Spontaneously breathing, nonintubated patients with acute respiratory failure may have a high respiratory drive and breathe with large tidal volumes and potentially injurious transpulmonary pressure swings. In patients with existing lung injury, regional forces generated by the respiratory muscles may lead to injurious effects on a regional level. In addition, the increase in transmural pulmonary vascular pressure swings caused by inspiratory effort may worsen vascular leakage. Recent data suggest that these patients may develop lung injury that is similar to the ventilator-induced lung injury observed in mechanically ventilated patients. As such, we argue that application of a lung-protective ventilation, today best applied with sedation and endotracheal intubation, might be considered a prophylactic therapy, rather than just a supportive therapy, to minimize the progression of lung injury from a form of patient self-inflicted lung injury.

Along these lines, there has been a vast increase in the use of machine learning models, in particular in the biomedical and clinical sciences, to try and keep pace with the rate of data generation. Recent successes now beg the question of whether mechanistic models are still relevant in this area.

	abstract = {Background—

Anticoagulation control with warfarin, as assessed by the international normalized ratio ({INR}), is challenging. Time in the therapeutic range has been inversely correlated with major hemorrhage, thrombosis, and mortality. Quest Diagnostics offers standardized {INR} laboratory testing services to approximately half of {US} physician practices. To inform national stroke prevention strategies, we evaluated anticoagulation control in office-based community practices.

Methods and Results—

We selected individuals with ≥2 months of {INR} data, {INR} results of {\textgreater}1.2, and an {ICD}-9 diagnosis code of atrial fibrillation. Frequency of {INR} testing and time in the therapeutic range were analyzed by age, sex, length of testing period, number of referred patients per provider, and median household income (based on home {ZIP} code). We identified 138 319 individuals referred by 37 939 physicians, yielding a total of 2 683 674 {INR} results. Patients had a mean age of 74 years; 81\% were ≥65 years of age, and 55\% were ≥75 years of age. The mean time in the therapeutic range was 53.7\% overall and improved with time on treatment, increasing from 47.6\% for patients with {\textless}6 months of testing to 57.5\% for those with ≥6 months of testing (P{\textless}0.0001). The number of patients tested per physician practice was positively associated with time in the therapeutic range. Younger age, female sex, and lower income were also independently associated with poorer anticoagulant control.

Conclusion—

This study demonstrates widespread suboptimal anticoagulation control, suggesting an urgent need to improve oral anticoagulation care for most patient segments in the United States.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Indeterminate randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) in {ARDS} may arise from sample size misspecification, leading to abandonment of efficacious therapies.
{RESEARCH} {QUESTIONS}: If evidence exists for sample size misspecification in {ARDS} {RCTs}, has this led to rejection of potentially beneficial therapies? Does evidence exist for prognostic enrichment in {RCTs} using mortality as a primary outcome?
{STUDY} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: We identified 150 {ARDS} {RCTs} commencing recruitment after the 1994 American European Consensus Conference {ARDS} definition and published before October 31, 2020. We examined predicted-observed sample size, predicted-observed control event rate ({CER}), predicted-observed average treatment effect ({ATE}), and the relationship between observed {CER} and observed {ATE} for {RCTs} with mortality and nonmortality primary outcome measures. To quantify the strength of evidence, we used Bayesian-averaged meta-analysis, trial sequential analysis, and Bayes factors.
{RESULTS}: Only 84 of 150 {RCTs} (56.0\%) reported sample size estimations. In {RCTs} with mortality as the primary outcome, {CER} was overestimated in 16 of 28 {RCTs} (57.1\%). To achieve predicted {ATE}, interventions needed to prevent 40.8\% of all deaths, compared with the original prediction of 29.3\%. Absolute reduction in mortality ≥ 10\% was observed in 5 of 28 {RCTs} (17.9\%) but was predicted in 21 of 28 {RCTs} (75.0\%). For {RCTs} with mortality as the primary outcome, no association was found between observed {CER} and observed {ATE} (pooled {OR}: β = -0.04; 95\% credible interval, -0.18 to 0.09). We identified three interventions that are not currently standard of care with a Bayesian-averaged effect size of {\textgreater} 0.20 and moderate strength of existing evidence: corticosteroids, airway pressure release ventilation, and noninvasive ventilation.
{INTERPRETATION}: Reporting of sample size estimations was inconsistent in {ARDS} {RCTs}, and misspecification of {CER} and {ATE} was common. Prognostic enrichment strategies in {ARDS} {RCTs} based on all-cause mortality are unlikely to be successful. Bayesian methods can be used to prioritize interventions for future effectiveness {RCTs}.},

A 25-year-male brought to the emergency department with approximately two feet perforating iron rod in the head, entering via frontal region, left side of midline and coming out of the occipital region. He developed right sided hemiplegia and global aphasia. He underwent series of imaging for the evaluation of the course of the iron rod and injury sustained because of it. Under strict aseptic precaution, iron rod removed in the operation theater. His clinical condition improved over a period of three weeks. At one year follow up- he had almost normal speech and language functions and was able to walk without support. This case illustrates the possibility of bizarre type of such injury in the presence of protective helmet and challenges in the management. Preoperative planning on the basis of images, prophylactic antibiotics and anticonvulsant medications, cleaning of the objects with antiseptic solutions, anterograde extraction after adequate exposure around entry and exit points resulted in good clinical outcome after successful removal of the rod.},

However, whether these measures are indeed suitable for K-means clustering remains unknown. Along this line, in this paper, we show that a data distribution view is of great use to selecting the right measures for K-means clustering. Specifically, we first introduce the data distribution view of K-means, and the resultant uniform effect on highly imbalanced data sets. Eight external measures widely used in recent data mining tasks are also collected as candidates for K-means evaluation. Then, we demonstrate that only three measures, namely the variation of information ({VI}), the van Dongen criterion ({VD}) and the Mirkin metric (M), can detect the negative uniform effect of K-means in the clustering results. We also provide new normalization schemes for these three measures, i.e., {VInorm}′, {VDnorm}′ and Mnorm′, which enables the cross-data comparisons of clustering qualities. Finally, we explore some properties such as the consistency and sensitivity of the three measures, and give some advice on how to use them in K-means practice.},

	abstract = {Purpose:  Individualising drug dosing using model-informed precision dosing ({MIPD}) of beta-lactam antibiotics and ciprofloxacin has been proposed as an alternative to standard dosing to optimise antibiotic efficacy in critically ill patients. However, randomised clinical trials ({RCT}) on clinical outcomes have been lacking.
Methods:  This multicentre {RCT}, including patients admitted to the intensive care unit ({ICU}) who were treated with antibiotics, was conducted in eight hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients were randomised to {MIPD} with dose and interval adjustments based on monitoring serum drug levels (therapeutic drug monitoring) combined with pharma‑cometric modelling of beta-lactam antibiotics and ciprofloxacin. The primary outcome was {ICU} length of stay ({LOS}). Secondary outcomes were {ICU} mortality, hospital mortality, 28-day mortality, 6-month mortality, delta sequential organ failure assessment ({SOFA}) score, adverse events and target attainment.
Results:  In total, 388 ({MIPD} n = 189; standard dosing n = 199) patients were analysed (median age 64 [{IQR} 55–71]). We found no significant differences in {ICU} {LOS} between {MIPD} compared to standard dosing (10 {MIPD} vs 8 standard dosing; {IRR} = 1.16; 95\% {CI} 0.96–1.41; p = 0.13). There was no significant difference in target attainment before inter‑vention at day 1 (T1) (55.6\% {MIPD} vs 60.9\% standard dosing; p = 0.24) or at day 3 (T3) (59.5\% vs 60.4\%; p = 0.84). There were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes.
Conclusions:  We could not show a beneficial effect of {MIPD} of beta-lactam antibiotics and ciprofloxacin on {ICU} {LOS} in critically ill patients. Our data highlight the need to identify other approaches to dose optimisation.},

In addition to the characteristics of acute diseases, geriatric conditions such as frailty, multimorbidity, cognitive impairment and functional disabilities were shown to influence outcome in that population. The goal of this study was to identify new and robust phenotypes based on the combination of these features to facilitate early outcome prediction.
Methods:  Patients aged 80 years old or older with and without limitations of life-sustaining treatment and with complete data were recruited from the {VIP}2 study for phenotyping and from the {COVIP} study for external validation. The sequential organ failure assessment ({SOFA}) score and its sub-scores taken on admission to {ICU} as well as demographic and geriatric patient characteristics were subjected to clustering analysis. Phenotypes were identified after repeated bootstrapping and clustering runs.
Results:  In patients from the {VIP}2 study without limitations of life-sustaining treatment (n = 1977), {ICU} mortality was 12\% and 30-day mortality 19\%. Seven phenotypes with distinct profiles of acute and geriatric characteristics were identified in that cohort. Phenotype-specific mortality within 30 days ranged from 3 to 57\%. Among the patients assigned to a phenotype with pronounced geriatric features and high {SOFA} scores, 50\% died in {ICU} and 57\% within 30 days. Mortality differences between phenotypes were confirmed in the {COVIP} study cohort (n = 280).
Conclusions:  Phenotyping of very old patients on admission to {ICU} revealed new phenotypes with different mortality and potential need for anticipatory intervention.},

Our aim was to examine the performance of various clustering strategies for mixed data using both simulated and real-life data. We conducted a benchmark analysis of “ready-to-use” tools in R comparing 4 model-based (Kamila algorithm, Latent Class Analysis, Latent Class Model [{LCM}] and Clustering by Mixture Modeling) and 5 distance/dissimilarity-based (Gower distance or Unsupervised Extra Trees dissimilarity followed by hierarchical clustering or Partitioning Around Medoids, K-prototypes) clustering methods. Clustering performances were assessed by Adjusted Rand Index ({ARI}) on 1000 generated virtual populations consisting of mixed variables using 7 scenarios with varying population sizes, number of clusters, number of continuous and categorical variables, proportions of relevant (non-noisy) variables and degree of variable relevance (low, mild, high). Clustering methods were then applied on the {EPHESUS} randomized clinical trial data (a heart failure trial evaluating the effect of eplerenone) allowing to illustrate the differences between different clustering techniques. The simulations revealed the dominance of K-prototypes, Kamila and {LCM} models over all other methods. Overall, methods using dissimilarity matrices in classical algorithms such as Partitioning Around Medoids and Hierarchical Clustering had a lower {ARI} compared to model-based methods in all scenarios. When applying clustering methods to a real-life clinical dataset, {LCM} showed promising results with regard to differences in (1) clinical profiles across clusters, (2) prognostic performance (highest C-index) and (3) identification of patient subgroups with substantial treatment benefit. The present findings suggest key differences in clustering performance between the tested algorithms (limited to tools readily available in R). In most of the tested scenarios, model-based methods (in particular the Kamila and {LCM} packages) and K-prototypes typically performed best in the setting of heterogeneous data.},

Design A survey of stakeholders’ opinions on the proposals.
Setting A web-based survey, open to international participation, for those with an interest in visualisation of time-to-event data.
Participants 1174 people participated in the survey over a 6-week period. Participation was global (although primarily Europe and North America) and represented a wide range of researchers (primarily statisticians and clinicians).
Main outcome measures Two outcome measures were of principal importance: (1) participants’ opinions of each proposal compared with a ‘standard’ Kaplan–Meier plot; and (2) participants’ overall ranking of the proposals (including the standard).
Results Most proposals were more popular than the standard Kaplan–Meier plot. The most popular proposals in the two categories, respectively, were an extended table beneath the plot depicting the numbers at risk, censored and having experienced an event at periodic timepoints, and {CIs} around each Kaplan–Meier curve.
Conclusions This study produced a high response number, reflecting the importance of graphics for time-to-event data. Those producing and publishing Kaplan–Meier plots—both authors and journals—should, as a starting point, consider using the combination of the two favoured proposals.},

        Prehospital resuscitation with single {IV} dose (250 cc) of 7.5\% saline in 6\% dextran-70, 7.5\% saline (no dextran), or crystalloid.
        {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: 
        Patients with increased serum chloride concentrations (110 mmol/L or greater) 24 hours after randomization were identified. Hyperchloremia was graded into one or greater than or equal to 2 occurrences in the first 24 hours. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the effects of hyperchloremia on: 1) death or severe disability at 180 days and 2) death within 180 days after adjusting for confounders. Compared with patients without hyperchloremia, patients with greater than or equal to 2 occurrences of hyperchloremia had significantly higher odds of death or severe disability at 180 days (odds ratio [{OR}], 1.81; 95\% {CI}, 1.19–2.75) and death within 180 days ({OR}, 1.89; 95\% {CI}, 1.14–3.08) after adjustment for confounders. However, the total volume of fluids administered during the first 24 hours was an independent predictor of death within 180 days; therefore, after adding an interaction term between the total volume of fluids administered during the first 24 hours and greater than or equal to 2 occurrences of hyperchloremia, patients with greater than or equal to 2 occurrences of hyperchloremia had significantly higher odds of death within 180 days ({OR}, 2.35; 95\% {CI}, 1.21–4.61 d) but not of composite outcome of death or severe disability at 180 days.
        {CONCLUSIONS}: 
        After modifying for the effect of the total volume of fluids administered during the first 24 hours, multiple occurrences of hyperchloremia in the first 24 hours were associated with higher odds of death within 180 days in patients with severe {TBI}.},

	abstract = {Variability in the control of oral anticoagulant therapy has been associated with a heightened risk of complications. We compared control of anticoagulation between two commonly used coumarins, phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol, and among anticoagulation clinics. All qualifying patients were managed at six regional anticoagulation clinics in the Netherlands. This retrospective cohort study compiled data during a three-year period from a computerised dosing and management system. Anticoagulation control was expressed as the percent of time within the therapeutic range and stability expressed as the time-weighted variance in the international normalised ratio ({INR}). Data were available for 22,178 patients of whom 72\% were treated with acenocoumarol. {INRs} of patients who received phenprocoumon were within the therapeutic range 50\% of the time compared with 43\% for acenocoumarol ({OR} 1.32, 95\% {CI} 1.24-1.41). Moreover, patients on phenprocoumon required 15\% fewer monitoring visits and had more stable {INR} values. These observations were consistent for all six clinics. There were also sizable differences between the clinics with respect to control and stability of anticoagulation that were stable from year-to-year and were unrelated to the drug used. With its longer half-life of three to five days, phenprocoumon produces more stable anticoagulation than acenocoumarol and should generally be the drug of choice when these are the available choices. The differences observed among clinics suggest that certain clinics employ policies and practices resulting in better control of anticoagulation.},

Heparin resistance to {UFH} was documented in 8/10 (80\%) patients and sub-optimal peak anti-Xa following therapeutic {LMWH} in 5/5 (100\%) patients where this was measured (some patients received both anticoagulants sequentially). Spiking plasma from 12 {COVID}-19 {ICU} patient samples demonstrated decreased in-vitro recovery of anti-Xa compared to normal pooled plasma.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The results of clinical trials often hinge on the quality of oral anticoagulation management, yet the quality of such management is frequently not mentioned or measured. Time-in-therapeutic range ({TTR}) is one measure of quality of anticoagulation dose management, but various methodologies exist for measuring {TTR}.
{OBJECTIVE}: This study was initiated to compare three commonly used methodologies for measuring {TTR} to see how they compare within the same cohort of patients.
{PATIENTS}/{METHODS}: Three common methodologies of calculating time-in-therapeutic range were analyzed retrospectively in a cohort of patients over six two-month intervals. Additional analysis was performed for three and six-month intervals. The methodologies included fraction of {INRs} in range; cross-section of the files; and linear interpolation.
{RESULTS}: Fraction of the {INRs} in range and cross-section of the files methodologies gave similar results, while linear interpolation yielded significantly shorter time-in-range for the two-month, three-month, and six-month intervals measured. The advantages and disadvantages of each methodology are discussed.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The decision of which method to use should be based on clinic size, information desired, and clinic resources for ease of applying either of the methods in clinical practice. Each of these methodologies has their limitations and the question remains as to which method best reflects the quality of anticoagulation management. Regardless of these limitations, investigators are urged to employ at least one method of measuring the quality of oral anticoagulation management so as to better assess the validity of the clinical outcomes.},
